0	sure, but that's not the choice.	It's not needed but can be helpful. It can also be harmful if you pick up bad habits you have to unlearn later. Many of the lesser programmers I know are those that came into college being self-taught and never learned the difference between computer science and software development (bad software development at that). It's not something you need to force before college in high school	fuck, why not south beach	dwz6dpv	dx3g4al	dwz6l0r	Pretty_Good_At_IRL	adjkant	Pretty_Good_At_IRL	8ag17u	8az434	8ag17u	Cornell	ApplyingToCollege	Cornell	0

2	Just tell me it's gonna be okay 	Thanks b, happy New Year!	You’re competitive for every college in America. Write good essays and emphasize your EC’s and you’ll get into a really good school next year.	7ncr3g	ds14e6v	e04jbp8	ridethatdickens	ridethatdickens	apost54	7ncr3g	7ncr3g	8olwwk	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	1
3	okay, thank you!	okay thank you- is there a specific part of my application that makes me a reach (so is there anything I can do to better my chances of getting in so that UCB is a match) or are these schools just too competitive to be matches for anyone but the absolute best?	an hour-2 hours. tbh a lot of companies won't be looking for freshmen but i think it shows a lot of initiative if you're there this early. i would target smaller companies though for a realistic chance at an internship (depending on your resume of course)	e04viek	e04u5nn	e5azso8	[deleted]	[deleted]	ilovemymemesboo	8olwwk	8olwwk	9bxmg0	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	Cornell	1

5	"&gt; Nah, was thinking more of like, 'upper-middle' tier houses (as long as they're not buttmad about being 'on the rise').
&gt; 
&gt; Rush is really simple - houses have open events, you go to them, meet as many people as you can and establish some friendly relationships (if you vibe with the people you're talking to), and that's it.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't have to prove your cool or anything - each house has like, a 'culture' and if you get along with that you're fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the top houses generally have an idea on who they're going to fill up their pledge class with before formal rush though because of already existing relationships (guys older brother is a senior, or someone knows incoming freshman from HS, etc.). So if you are really going to gun for a top house or something ask your cousin to bring you to some parties/kickbacks so you can meet some brothers before you're allowed to rush (spring of freshman year)

My cousin is graduating in June, and she's a girl. But like, is there any way to go to these kickbacks/parties solo?

I heard what you said about Top rush from other people, but I heard that it's possible to get in even if you're not in that category.



FWIW, I spend every other day M,W,F, at a local community college taking courses. And the girls in my cousin's sorority are just as hot. Have you ever been to a mixer with Alpha Phi girls, they're smoking!"	I've been set on going to Cornell since I was a freshman in HS. I know that I'm not there yet, but I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for it.	BC is useless in real life. Pretty much everything after precalc tbh!

6	"&gt;  I think ILR/AEM/Hotel has a ton of people in Greek life, which might explain the whiteness + appearance of wealth

This makes no sense to me. Maybe because I'm not yet at Cornell, but what does participation in Greek life have to do with being white? Uh, are P.O.C excluded from frats? The kid who was leading my tour at Cornell was the president of a fraternity, and he was black. Maybe I misunderstood you. 

And fraternities are determined by familial wealth? That sucks because one of the things I most looked forward to was Greek life .. When I went to visit, my guide said that the top fraternities take anyone, ""as long as they're cool"", but I guess there's some coded language in that"	Ezra made a mistake.	"&gt; My father was a DU way back when, so obviously my info is outdated for frats, but my sister is in a sorority at Cornell. They have a certain type of person they want. Social media plays a part in confirming/denying that.

What kind of person? If you don't mind me asking..

And my cousin who goes to Cornell now is also in a sorority (Alpha Phi). She's graduating this year tho :(, and she met her BF at Cornell. "	duquqw6	dx1kur9	duv9mph	KentuckyJew01	ithacating	KentuckyJew01	7zmvva	8ag17u	7zmvva	Cornell	Cornell	Cornell	0
