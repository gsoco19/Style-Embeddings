0	sure, but that's not the choice.	"I think there's value in learning how to pitch yourself, but as someone who was pretty sure I was applying to PhD programs by the start of freshman year, I also didn't find it particularly useful. 

There weren't really any BME-relevant companies that came, although that's supposed to be changing in the coming years. "	fuck, why not south beach	dwz6dpv	e5bct98	dwz6l0r	Pretty_Good_At_IRL	laveritecestla	Pretty_Good_At_IRL	8ag17u	9bxmg0	8ag17u	Cornell	Cornell	Cornell	0

3	okay, thank you!	okay thank you- is there a specific part of my application that makes me a reach (so is there anything I can do to better my chances of getting in so that UCB is a match) or are these schools just too competitive to be matches for anyone but the absolute best?	What questions did you ask? Congrats on the good-ass interview! 	e04viek	e04u5nn	ds605x7	[deleted]	[deleted]	Klamorre	8olwwk	8olwwk	7nznhu	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	1
4	Nah Colleges can only see letter grades so they can't recalculate 	I would not worry about your course load affecting your admissions, but ofc everyone looks at it differently. I definitely think you are Regents material especially for Berkeley because I really think they are looking for fit. UC's were brutal last year but I think Berkeley hasn't changed much compared to the rest of the UCs. Good luck, you're already amazing! message me any time if you consider the UC's for help, I was a Berkeley Regents Candidate.

5	"&gt; Nah, was thinking more of like, 'upper-middle' tier houses (as long as they're not buttmad about being 'on the rise').
&gt; 
&gt; Rush is really simple - houses have open events, you go to them, meet as many people as you can and establish some friendly relationships (if you vibe with the people you're talking to), and that's it.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't have to prove your cool or anything - each house has like, a 'culture' and if you get along with that you're fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the top houses generally have an idea on who they're going to fill up their pledge class with before formal rush though because of already existing relationships (guys older brother is a senior, or someone knows incoming freshman from HS, etc.). So if you are really going to gun for a top house or something ask your cousin to bring you to some parties/kickbacks so you can meet some brothers before you're allowed to rush (spring of freshman year)

My cousin is graduating in June, and she's a girl. But like, is there any way to go to these kickbacks/parties solo?

I heard what you said about Top rush from other people, but I heard that it's possible to get in even if you're not in that category.



FWIW, I spend every other day M,W,F, at a local community college taking courses. And the girls in my cousin's sorority are just as hot. Have you ever been to a mixer with Alpha Phi girls, they're smoking!"	I've been set on going to Cornell since I was a freshman in HS. I know that I'm not there yet, but I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for it.

6	"&gt;  I think ILR/AEM/Hotel has a ton of people in Greek life, which might explain the whiteness + appearance of wealth

This makes no sense to me. Maybe because I'm not yet at Cornell, but what does participation in Greek life have to do with being white? Uh, are P.O.C excluded from frats? The kid who was leading my tour at Cornell was the president of a fraternity, and he was black. Maybe I misunderstood you. 

And fraternities are determined by familial wealth? That sucks because one of the things I most looked forward to was Greek life .. When I went to visit, my guide said that the top fraternities take anyone, ""as long as they're cool"", but I guess there's some coded language in that"	"Even if you can't get credit, you can take the CASE! It's a placement exam that grants you equivalent credit if you pass. The specific grade you get is never revealed to anyone (even you) and you get credit for the equivalent course with a grade of S.

If you've taken a year of calculus based physics at AP level, you can definitely pass the 1112 CASE with a bit a review. I took it last semester having only taken algebra-based physics and passed. I'm not sure about the 2213 CASE, but it certainly doesn't hurt to try since the worst case scenario is just you having to take the class."	"&gt; My father was a DU way back when, so obviously my info is outdated for frats, but my sister is in a sorority at Cornell. They have a certain type of person they want. Social media plays a part in confirming/denying that.

What kind of person? If you don't mind me asking..

And my cousin who goes to Cornell now is also in a sorority (Alpha Phi). She's graduating this year tho :(, and she met her BF at Cornell. "	duquqw6	dxqs43u	duv9mph	KentuckyJew01	Dhuzy	KentuckyJew01	7zmvva	8dtupn	7zmvva	Cornell	Cornell	Cornell	0
