It’s like if you’re driving down the road without a licence and you get pulled over, well you’re in a spot of bother.

&gt;“They were members of parliament, but it’s quite clear on Section 44, you can’t be a member of parliament and have dual citizenship - it's black and white.

&gt;“I don’t think it is [time to have a look at Section 44 of the constitution], I think you've just got to do your homework and make sure you're not a citizen of two countries when you stand for parliament.

&gt;“Now Larissa said she believed that was not the case, and I’m sure that would be the outcome for Scott Ludlum, but unfortunately, ignorance is not an excuse.

&gt; ***Ignorance Is Not An Excuse*** - Barnaby Joyce 2017"	I was about to correct your grammar, but then I learned the word 'gotten' is only used in American English.	Wow, count me in! Thanks for doing this :D	What the fuck even is the source of this? Is there a recording of the whole meeting? This *was* in a private meeting where he's supposed to improve right, so what did they just completely disregard that? Were that trying to take him down or get money from him or something? Do we have any context outside of like 2 lines? The whole thing is super fucking fishy. And all these organizations out here are making all these fucking changes right away before we even have information. It's like the fucking salem trials out here.	I like him too, but it's kinda weird to root for him to survive when he wants to die.	I've lived on a submarine and we had control over our own atmosphere. At low oxygen levels, you'd feel lethargic and tired. At higher oxygen levels you'd feel hyper. It doesn't take much of a difference for this to be noticable, a few percent either way made a big difference. Your body will adjust over time with different red blood cell concentrations, something noticeable in altitude training.	"Sadly, only 3 of my native-speaker friends were available right now, which doesn't make for a good sample size. But to my surprise, my findings speak admittedly in your favor.

When asked whether they would recognize ""deo"" as shortening of ""deodorant""

- 33% answered ""definately lol""

- 66% answered ""nope""

Furthermore, participant 2 attests to never having heard of it and participant 3 claims that ""most people probably wouldn't get it"".

I stand corrected and accept my defeat.

Bonus round: However, my data supports my hypothesis that I would not look like an idiot"	She left it in the ditch, remember?	You misspelled Quebec city!	"Have the one that have made it recently been anti-Trudeau? I'm wondering if it's not the other way around - where most don't care for him, and he makes the front page exceptionally, when there's 'brigading' from your side.

(With brigading being shorthand for 'voted for or against')."	"Watched the video... Star of the game! 

"	This question would be better posed in r/television or r/movies.	While Google's cloud is competitive, I disagree with you. Please take a look at the article I linked. Also, if you have an azure account or Google cloud account, go check out the pricing for yourself.	"&gt; Mine has to be Cynthia lee Fontaine’s

I mean you could have just stopped there. S9 was just a conveyor belt of hideous."	This volume is why I don't want to start Thompson over Peterson in the flex tomorrow. I might just play it safe for Peterson's floor.	"For you last question there, say you had some sorcery that had sent effect along with ""you may play an additional land this turn"". Now this card works fine until you [[quicken]] it and cast it at instant speed during an opponent's turn. The rules prevent you from playing a land on their turn, even though the card said you can play an extra this turn.  
Basically they only want lands to be played on your own turns, probably because it's wonky with priority to do it any other way?"	"Shit thing to do, sounds like you're legitimately remorseful about it; so that's a start, but remorse does not a better man make. I don't know if there's much point to owning up to it and apologizing, though there might be. At the very least let this be a good lesson into how shit of a person you have the capacity to be, and always act in a way to steer clear of that. No amount of alcohol or buddies spurring you on excuses any of this, only trying your hardest never to sink so low again will make this into anything besides an embarrassing example of just how worthless you can be at a careless moment.

I, too, have this deep-seated shit person, this useless loser, inside of me and I have to work my hardest every day to be even a tiny step above worthless; so take it from me that this is best treated as a lesson for the future."	The argument is that the sports program generates a lot of revenue for itself.	This is going to sound weird but soak a washcloth in milk and hold it against your vaginal area to ease any irritation there... just be sure to rinse thoroughly after... that plus the ibuprofen should help.	Which player on the list would you trade Chara 1 for 1 for, assuming Chara was on a different team?	Dying — that gif is the best TL:DR possible.	Good practice for refining your targeting systems, I guess.	[That joke has been around since at least 1937.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/03/07/haggling/)	"I think you mean Apple Maps.

Apple Maps gets my wife and I lost every time. I use Google, never a problem."	"The scariest thing to me when I hear these stories is what we're these parents like in this child's infancy? The right brain, which basically determines our mental health, our ability to appropriately appraise internal and external stimuli and regulate emotions correctly, houses all our unconscious ""knowledge"" and implicit schemas, develops in those first three years of life necessarily in the interpersonal context of our relationship with our parents. Our parents regulate our brain chemistry for us, control how much NT floods our developing brain and therefore has a huge impact on how it develops structurally and psychologically."	"As another old gamer with limited time, another word of caution: the game does that roguelike one-save, autosave thing. 

On multiple occasions, I've put hours into a game only to run into a ship that I have no chance against. (And, of course, there's no real indication that I have no chance so I don't avoid the battle.) Being defeated in itself doesn't end the game, it just leaves me so screwed (dead crew, broke ship, penniless) that there's really no point in continuing. And, since it's a rogue-like, I can't just load an earlier save. So there went the last X hours of my limited gaming time.

All of which is fine if that's your thing. But, as an old man whose gaming time is more precious than any jewel, it feels like a waste."	"""Shuffle your library"" seems to have been shortened to ""Shuffle"" in the reminder text. Great change if this is the new standard."	Am I the only one that looked at those when I was 16 like.... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	I'm pretty sure this is what DJ wants. His coach, Matt Hume is at ONE Championship. 	"That's exactly what they're saying. That's why it's a term. When you call someone a pussy, you're saying they're like a female, weak.

When you call someone a dick, you're saying they're like a man, a jerk.

Both aren't cool."	"&gt;Everyone telling you to hodl, they're only looking out for their own interests. They're not going to tell you to sell, that would just drop the price down even further.

It's not 2009 anymore. Some random guy on Reddit isn't going to move the price enough for it to be worth anyone's time convincing him, and the whales who matter aren't going to listen to us.

Bitcoin has no mechanism (yet) for funding public goods like marketing. I think most people saying ""hodl"" right now are being genuinely altruistic, because they were in that situation once."	Exactly! You might even be able to run an auger like this off the back of a skid steer tractor (Bobcat). 	Kings can't decide if they're a playoff team.	"The defensive CR is definitely bumped up a bit due to the fact that it's got a fair assortment of damage immunities.

Though, even discounting those, it'd only drop to CR 7 according to the math, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"	"&gt;the other options are just as bad( Bolsonaro just a bit worse though). 

I've only read some of the linked stuff in this thread, but I fail to see how the others can possibly be ""just as bad"" given some of the things he's explicitly quoted as saying. 

Reads like the whole ""but her emails"" excuse all over again. "	"&gt;sexism is related to power structures

Says no dictionary ever."	"That's circular reasoning.
""More men play games, so we don't need women leads.""
 But also, there's mostly male leads, so women could feel off put because they are represented."	And now that the corporate tax rate is lower, said corporations have less short-term incentive to invest revenue in R&amp;D work. 	Like four people worked on the game total. Selling 3 million units is a HUGE deal for a team that size and an impressive feat for larger teams. Take off your half-empty glasses. 	The Greeks were literally stripping material from Acropolis to build huts among the ruins. 	A Starbomb reference in the wild? Nice!	Take a shower. It's not that difficult.	Here, I'll lay it out for you. Pyro reflects everything, and has dispensers. All you have is a health pack, not ammo. You tell me what happens next.	Guys, he's just showing us a curiosity and giving examples for a matter of comparison...	You guessed wrong. I was 12 when the Gamecube came out. While I never had one, I was gaming on other platforms back then, and I definitely remember bugs and glitches.	Most people don't know shit and are unable to decouple capitalism from the free market. By what measure is a good question, I'd say its contribution to human existence has been mostly negative, whether we're talking about the standard of living, sustainability, habitat destruction, loss of life, pollution, corruption, job security, well paying jobs, really most things. I keep having to repeat this one thing, that the good things people believe came from capitalism are mostly the result of the market and new technology, it's misattribution to credit capitalism with the success for what happens as a result of the market and new technology, instead capitalism has destroyed countless countries for the sake of war profiteering and continues to do so. The reason capitalism hasn't already destroyed itself are the very restraints it seeks to undermine, but it has still resulted in the boom and bust cycle and caused unlimited misery and suffering all over the world.	We tried that with fiber...	If you're not up for paying or want to manage the hosting of yours yourself (if you want to keep it in the cloud), I recommend KeePass. Have been using it for years. 	You just can't deny that Epic knows what the hell they're doing with this game. As a someone who much prefers the military sim style of PUBG I can't help but be jealous. PUBG Corp may have the best intentions in the world, but it really has become clear they have little to no QA and very little experience as gamers. On top of a base game that was so poorly designed that things need to be completely redone in order to fix them, it makes me incredibly disappointed. 	[FTFY](https://i.imgur.com/2zFz32D.jpg).

It isn't, because that's not what a Deus ex machina is."	"Trump never was a bankrupt.

Some of his companies bankrupt which is pretty normal thing when someone have a lot of companies."	"It's fun because I follow a podcast about a British guy living in Japan, and he said that it was difficult at first to understand what Japanese meant at first because they hate being direct. And one of the examples he cites is precisely about windows. A coworker casually commented that it was hot in the office, until he understood that she meant ""open the window please"" after the third time she mentioned.

I don't know if it's true, but from what I hear, it's like Japanese people are British on steroids and Germans are the complete opposite of that."	"That can be said of any photograph; it is not specific to war photography.

E.G.: [Protestors bussed into town to protest Trump.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anti-trump-protesters-bused-into-austin/) It was a series of false allegations made in late 2016."	It sounds like it was just the reason why they get approached all the time and if he didn't say that but just left it as, they are fun because they always get approached by new people, and you might ask why. In context that doesn't seem that strange is just him giving the explanation preemptively. 	At the ND watch party at the 45 in Portland.

Personally, I rolled my own (using MessageDigest on Java). And I've also used openssl, but good luck explaining to people who never even touched the command line before on how to use it (or even just installing the required packages for them to be able to use it on their Windows box).

Whereas you tell them to download a single program that can do what they need for a few clicks, I don't see the issue (especially since it's all for an OFFLINE backup process anyway).

And I don't see how Truecrypt 7.1a is insecure, it uses AES and it's been audited by a third-party. There should be no issues especially since it's not going to be used on something that will be placed online to be open to attack.

All you basically need is something SIMPLE enough that any average joe can understand your explanation, and something not as obvious as having their seed words written on a piece of paper that can be stolen by a thief that knows about bitcoin.

Anything over that is just unnecessary.

And also using an encrypted filesystem offers plausible deniability (if you use a hidden partition). Especially if you were found by a physical attacker by doxxing you from something related to crypto. You can place a dummy wallet there, or even some porn.

It's generally just easier to calculate how much sugar, fibers, protein, etc. you're going to get by consuming the food by using the percentages and how much you were actually going to consume, rather than using some arbitrary serving size that you're not going to follow anyway. Sure, for things like cookies you want to have information listed per cookie as well.

Maybe. It's possible that you all converge onto a palatable decision that isn't object, but just falls within the norms of the 3-4 of you. Objective analysis gets pushed to the side and subjective popularity points surge to the top when evaluating a candidate in that situation.

Maybe if the 3-4 just submitted their own tech feedback without meeting first, then you could have a more objective reference point and also from multiple people (maybe interviewer 2 just didn't like him, that's often a huge factor in grading and why 2 people don't get along is super complex but 2 other people do).

My prof has a policy where if you catch somebody cheating in class and tell him, you get 5 points added to your exam grade. Our class uses iclickers, which is basically a remote that you use to answer questions in lecture and take attendance. Sometimes people will give their friends their iclickers if they don't feel like going to class but still want the quiz/attendance points. My prof counts this as cheating and will give us the extra points if we let him know about people with multiple clickers. 

The kid next to me in lecture brings like 3 or 4 clickers with him every class. I normally wouldn't give a shit, personally I don't even believe it counts as cheating but honestly I could use 5 points extra on a test. It's a difficult class and points are points... WIBTA if I ratted him out?

&gt; There's nothing stopping anyone on your team from trading everything they know about your operation for a briefcase full of cash right now.

It's extremely rare that a reputable company would ever agree to something so explicitly criminal, even assuming the person on our team would. And it doesn't work that way, they can't just sit in a room and write down everything they know. It's lots of small details that will be filled in various places, that will interlock with details they can't fill in that will have to come from people in the hiring company. So they basically have to work with them over a period of time.

The whole point with non-competes is that while they are restrictive, paid non-competes are sufficiently reasonably (and they're usually quite narrow too; I could e.g. go work for Google or even many finance companies that aren't direct competitors the morning after I quit my job) that they don't incentivize the worker to break the law.

Your workers are paid using the cheaper currency, while your buyers get more bang for their buck making your product look like a comparatively good deal.

The low dollar helps manufacturing and exports to some extent, but it's a temporary bandaid that may hurt long-term development more than it helps. Technology purchased from the US and overseas becomes more expensive, so companies have less ability to invest in modernizing their production line. It also becomes increasingly difficult to retain mobile high tech talent because the low dollar magnifies the salary differential, which makes establishing, growing, and retaining companies in the ""new economy"" that everyone talks about wanting to build more difficult. 

And if the dollar dips below historical lows (which it may well, given the significant drop in FDI over the last three years and the increasing sense that Canada is a place where capital investment goes to die), it's inevitable that our standard of living will drop as costs for imported things like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment become more expensive. (A lot of us are starting to feel this on a micro level; I have some personal projects on the side that could eventually be profitable, but as costs rise, whether it's even worth it becomes harder to justify to my wife.) Resources industries may increasingly be seen as undesirable to many, but they do help to support the way of life we've become accustomed to, and provide the financial resources to diversify into new areas.

In general, higher prices of a given commodity typically leads to a higher supply of said commodity. This is because companies are attracted to producing commodities whose prices have risen, or are relatively high. And, in general, higher supply leads to lower prices.

Making it illegal to raise prices on drugs is price control. Price control is almost always very bad since it distorts the market. One effect of setting a price ceiling is that of disincentivizing companies from producing that price-controlled commodity. 

So if less companies are incentivized from producing this price-controlled drug, then less companies will produce this drug. What does this lead to? It leads to a lower supply of drugs. Assuming the demand for that price-controlled drug hasn't dropped dramatically, price controls will lead to higher prices.

It'd take more time and effort, but overall I'm a *slightly* better person than somebody who just decided to kill the mice. 

Now pretend I'm omnipotent. I can just instantly whisk the mice away into a field someplace else instead of letting them get killed in my trap. If I don't, it doesn't matter *much*, since mice still are dumb and barely matter, but I'd be a better person if I did. 

If I want to be omnibenevolent, I always have to opt for the more moral choice. If God wants to get rid of the imperfections in his creation, he's omniscient, so he'd know not to create them in the first place, and he's omnipotent so he can easily fix them in a moral way.

"The sources on immigrants committing less crime only ""associate""- meaning correlate- the rising number of immigrants in between 1990 and 2013 with lower rates of violent crime that also happened during that period. That decline can easily be explained by other factors, such as the transition from cash to credit (since robbing someone has a lower reward when a credit card can be flagged or canceled). Correlation is not causation.

Incarceration numbers are tough too, because if a crime committed by an immigrant is serious enough, he is deported instead of incarcerated, which is specifically stated as not counted in the CATO source. Therefore it makes sense that the incarceration levels for immigrants will be lower, for that reason alone.

I'm not suggesting that immigrants do commit more crimes than natives, since I don't have the evidence to bring (although illegal immigrants- or whatever you want to call them- are breaking the law by- usually- overstaying their visa). But overall, it is not cut and dry that immigrants lead to lower crime rates.

"&gt; The right solution is for mobile operating systems to ask users whether they want to share personal information with an app, and if the answer is no, the app should get fake data instead of real data.

Right so first, the reason that this was happening was due to poor permission grouping in API 15 (or less) which is now deprecated. Users have to explicitly give Facebook access to Phone and Messaging now instead of just the Contacts permission (which users always had the option to revoke). 

I don't think this is a good idea for the end-user who isn't tech savvy. Say someone installs a Calendar app, and fat fingers the Calendar permission off. Now instead of the app being able to inform the user that it lacks a required permission, they would just see a bunch of junk data, thinking that the app is busted and giving it a bad review.

* Control rents on buildings constructed after 1995. The law also locked into place rules in cities with rent control when Costa-Hawkins passed like 1978 in Los Angeles. 

Prop. 10 simply repeals that law, allowing cities and counties to do what they want on rent control.

So to your point, yes it's possible that cities and counties — and organizations trying to add rent control via initiative — would try to extend rent control to single-family homes and/or to new apartment construction. However, proponents of the measure say there's no modern rent control regime that includes new construction and little interest in extending rent control to single-family homes owned by individuals rather than institutional investors.

In short, yes if Prop. 10 passes, cities and counties could do what you're saying. But supporters say it's unlikely to happen. -Liam"	"Fair enough, I obviously wasn't there and was going based off of what was readily available in the footage of the incident.

"So, the general thrust of the linked comment is that moving to a newer DX version wouldn't really improve matters, as that isn't where the problem actually is. In fact, the original article pointed out the same problem: the change to DX12 originally had little impact on many players, as the real bottleneck was in multithreading, just like in GW2 but with a newer DX version.

So, would allowing for more multithreading, regardless of DX version, make GW2 run better? Absolutely, for those who could take advantage of it. The issue is that ANet would still need to support the less-efficient version to avoid making the game run worse for anyone who can't take advantage of it, which means they would need to put a lot more resources into maintaining those parts of the game. It would also make expanding the engine and adding new functionality harder, as they would need to make any new features function correctly for both versions; as such, in practical terms they wouldn't be able to use the multithreading for anything aside from a performance boost on some computers.

Blizzard, as others have noted, can much more easily afford to do this (largely on account of having more money to throw around), and in fact have probably dedicated resources to maintaining this sort of system for many years now. ANet could, in theory, do the same, but it would probably require them cutting back resources somewhere else, and presumably they've decided that isn't the direction they want to go."

"My parents separated when I was 7 and I lived with my dad every weekend until I was 14, at which point I found the courage to say no because his place was a pigsty. When I stopped going to his place, he began coming to my grandmother's house where I live every weekend with 30 to 60 dollars of fast food to give me as a gift.

At first I accepted the food because I understood he just wanted to see me and show me that he loves me. But my problem was that money adds up over time, and teenage me would have rather had my dad save 30 to 60 dollars a week for a future car, college expenses, or just a regular old savings account. I felt it was wasteful for my father to blow hundreds of dollars a month on this food, so I told him how I felt and he would become angry. The first conversation we had about the issue went like this:

*Me:* Dad, I think it's nice that you want to show your affection for me by giving me this fast food, but I'd rather you put this money toward more useful things. If you want to spend this money on me, I'd be happier if you saved for something like a car or college. Also, you don't need to bring gifts in order to see me every weekend; you can just come see me!

*Dad*: Oh, but I have to make sure you're well feed and getting adequate nutrition.

*Me:* I've never gone hungry in my life nor given you any reason to think so. Plus, there is nothing nutritious at all about fried chicken and pizza.

*Dad:* Fried chicken has protein. I have to make sure you're getting enough protein and drinking fluids.

*Me:* Dad, the things you're saying don't make sense. Everyone knows that fried chicken and soda are unhealthy. If you want me to be healthy, you can spend this money on buying actual healthy foods from a supermarket, and it would cost less money. But since this is supposed to be a gift *for me*, I'm telling you that I'd rather you save this money on something more useful.

*Dad:* If you ever need money you can just tell me and I'll give it to you, but I'm also going to give you this food.

*Me:* Can you give me ten thousands dollars?

*Dad:* No, that's too much money for me right now.

*Me:* Well that's just a fraction of what college will cost, so if you can't give me ten thousand dollars right now, that's all the more reason for you to save this money instead of spending it on chicken and pizza *which I have explicitly told you I do not want.*

*Dad:* You're being very selfish.

*Me:* How is it selfish for me to say I don't want you to buy me something?

*Dad:* I think that your mother and I spoiled you rotten, that's what I think. I'm giving you a gift and you're acting like a spoiled brat.

*Me:* The first time you gave me this fast food it was a gift, and I accepted it. But when you buy something over and over again, and the person directly tells you they don't want it, that's not a gift anymore.

*Dad:* [More angry things.]

I wasn't an assertive person back then, so I would just gave up and let him continue to buy the food. He happily bought the food for years as if that whole argument never happened. Oh, and after the first couple years he stopped physically coming to my grandmother's house. Instead, he would call his favorite pizza restaurant and have them deliver 40+ dollars worth of pizza. I physically see my dad a handful of times a year. I've invited him to come here a few times, to spend holidays with me, but he would rather be by himself and send 40+ dollars worth of fast food.

I've had a couple more arguments like that over the past ten years, and they were all the same. One time I held my ground and refused to accept any fast food for a year. During this year I had even less contact with him than usual, and after that year he still wanted to buy me fast food so I acquiesced.

It's been ten years now, and he's cumulatively spent thousands of dollars on food I told him I don't want. I accept that this was largely my fault for being a push-over, and now I'm going to start rejecting the food again.

I know I'm an adult and I'm not entitled to my fathers money. I recently needed 300 dollars to fix my laptop, and he gave it to me as a loan. I'm totally okay with that, but I'm not going to accept 60 dollars of stupid fucking pizza when he's *loaning* me money I need for school.

I told my dad I'm going on a diet as a new years resolution and he still asks me if I want the pizza; so far I've said no every time. I know that his makes him unhappy, but I feel like I'm not to blame. I suspect that he does this because in his own twisted way, it makes him feel like he is a good, providing father. He has a mental issue and I refuse to enable it any longer.

Big tech evade US corporate taxes by bribing politicians and threatening to workers elsewhere. Considering they employ so few, and have no major infrastructure behind them except for Amazon (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc are all just software companies that have some manufacturing... in Asia) they aren't stuck in any one city, state, or even country, and their insane size makes them individually economically larger than most eastern European nations.

Every nation on the planet prostates itself at the feet of those 5 (and often Samsung, Sony, etc) to try to get some of their workers living in their countries because they are awash in so much money. It doesn't even matter if their presence doesn't positively impact your ability to keep functional infrastructure or security in your nation because they pay negative taxes, their presence acts as a gravity well to pull in all kinds of tech investment.

"In the original, they kept his details extremely vague in order to portray him as *absolute* in his evil ways.

He didn't follow Laurie because she was his sister, either; he followed her because he saw her outside his old home and wanted to kill her.

That's what was so creepy about the original Myers; he did it for no reason. There was nothing preceding his mental break, either. The lack of any motive (revenge, greed, lust, whatever) adds to the horror. It's scarier when you can't relate to a villain, because you don't always know what to expect from them.

"There's a plan by extremist Christians to make everyone follow Christianity. They keep pushing for ""Christian laws"" - everything from Christian prayers in schools to teaching Christian creationism as an ""alternative"" to evolution to insisting that all politicians making the laws need to follow the Christian Bible. Anyone who isn't Christian might not be forced to convert (at first), but they will be forced to abide by Christian laws or else.

Most of these groups also take the view that the end times are approaching and to hasten it Israel must be controlled by the Jewish people. This lets them appear to be friendly to Jews, but the second part of their apocalypse fantasy requires all Jews (like me) to convert to Christianity. Groups with significant political power like the Southern Baptists have made it their mission to convert all Jews to Christianity. They've even formed groups to trick Jews into converting. (Jews For Jesus - which was formed when they realized people didn't convert upon being threatened with hell.)

I've experienced this first hand when an older couple tried to convince me and my family that we could worship Jesus and still be Jewish. When I refused, they kept pressuring us to convert.

"I do appreciate your perspective and I don't know the conditions over there. I can only give my own anecdotes. 

My mom was a high school principal and teacher for 10 years. I can tell you she spent most of the school holidays doing full days at the office, the only difference was she got home a little earlier. During school days she rarely got home before 8pm and was very often still preparing teacher schedules and stuff like that at home. 

Granted part of that was because apparently her deputy principals were useless and she often had to take on a lot of their work. 

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher, she spends most of the holidays finishing marking, because it's not just ticking boxes - students need individual feedback and analysis on how they're doing in various areas. Now multiply that by like 200 students. Also on lesson planning for the next semester because god knows how they're expected to prepare lessons during the school period with everything else going on (remember they have to mark holiday homework when school starts again so they'll have no time). Also finishing paperwork for their department, attending conferences, dealing with parents etc. 

I'm not saying they don't have holidays, and by all means there are careers that have worse hours. And they can often do their work at home during this time, meaning that they do have some capacity to look after children. But the idea that being a teacher is less than a full time job because of school holidays is, in my opinion, absurd.

If you can see a screen-door effect when using sharpest focus on a projector, you are seeing about 5-10x the resolution of the projected pixels both horizontally and vertically, since the interstitial spaces are much smaller than the pixels. Since the dimensions project in a 2-dimensional plane, this equates to being able to resolve 25 to 100 times the number of pixels visible at 1080P. 

Even that does not indicate that the limit of your vision, it only establishes a minimum. A 4k picture has only 4 times the pixels of a 1080P picture. That leaves it short of the limits of human vision by a significant margin.

Edit: Also, using my 27"" 4k computer monitor from several feet away I can see ""jaggies"" if a drawn line is not anti-aliased. I suspect that human vision is capable of resolving differences between resolutions that are at least an order of magnitude higher than 4k (i.e. 40k). The fact that images are routinely anti-aliased or pixels are interpolated as an average over an area in image creation, combined with the human mind's innate ability to fill in and smooth details, is what gives lower resolutions their ""lifelike"" appearance.

&gt; I don't work in medicine, but I love research and learning, and this is a personal interest topic of mine. There are many studies and articles around to read for those who want to. Summary of it all is that we have more bacterial cells in us than actual human cells. They all seem to perform different roles in our health and can affect hormone levels, weight gain or loss, mental health, and cause or prevent diseases, allergies and food intolerances. When things get badly out of balance, they can cause the body to start attacking itself as in autoimmune disorders.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, I went to the doctor because of low energy, high stress, and blood tests showed I was in ""premature ovarian failure"" (ie early menopause). After a friend died in January, my digestion stopped working and I couldn't eat anything other than soup without agonising stomach pain and bloating. Doc suggested I get my microbiome screened at a lab in Australia (I live in NZ) called Bioscreen. It cost around A$500 for the works, then another $50 for my doc to get together with a local microbiologist to understand the results and come up with a treatment plan. My insurance is for surgery cover, so doesn't cover this.
&gt; 
&gt; For me, the results showed I have way too many streptococcus and too few E.coli. (Quoting from the microbiologist:) ""E.coli is an important intestinal micro-organism responsible for the synthesis of essential amino acids (eg. trytophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) vitamins (folic acid, vit K2) and coenzymes (CoQ10) important for cellular metabolism and reproduction. Determination into the levels of these essential amino acids in patients with persistent and chronic low levels of E.coli may be beneficial. Acute depletion of tyrosine and phenylalanine has shown to have selective effect on decision-making in depressive patients.""
&gt; 
&gt; This makes sense to me as my brain has felt a bit sub-par in recent years and I've been taking L-Tyrosine supplements, which help.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other bacteria that are also out of balance too, and I have blastocystis, which are microscopic parasites common in the developing world that I most likely picked up during travelling. My body's absorbing too much fat from the food I eat (I have put on fat around my middle that I never used to have), and is reabsorbing estrogen, putting all my sex hormones out of balance. My liver's having to deal with too much toxicity as a result, and my pancreas isn't working properly, the doc says.
&gt; 
&gt; My treatment plan involves a complex regime of certain antibiotics (to suppress the blastocystis - impossible to get rid of them completely, but at low levels they're not a problem for most people) and specific probiotics to bump up the types of bacteria I want, then more antibiotics and probiotics to rebalance the strep and e.coli. I have to practice mindfulness twice a day to calm my mind (there is a 2-way feedback loop between gut and brain), and completely cut out carbs including fruit for a month to starve the streptococcus (although should eat figs as they have a special type of sugar, fucose, that only e.coli can digest), then eat a low-ish carb diet with lots of vegetables.
&gt; 
&gt; Doc says to allow 2-3 years to completely fix this. It's taken a lifetime to get this unwell, so it takes a long time to rectify.
&gt; 
&gt; All the physical and mental stresses of life can affect your microbiome, the biggest being whether you're born the conventional way and pick up your mother's bacteria during the process, or by c-section. Whether you're breastfed or not; any surgery has a big impact as it's a major stress on the body and has been shown to change the shape of our bacteria; composition and variety of diet; antibiotics you've taken or you've eaten in food (ie used on animals); sleep patterns; medicines you've taken (even paracetamol); your exposure to bacteria from other people, animals, playing in the dirt as a child, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; It's an incredibly complex area of medicine and there's a lot of research going on at the moment. The composition of your microbiome can change the way your body responds to medicines, and I personally believe that understanding the microbiome will allow doctors to create personalised medicine and diet plans in the future.

"One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.

Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation."

Which is exactly what this dude did.   

The sad part is that the ""failing"" of Tesla and the Rental company is par for the course on most companies that don't take security seriously.    

For instance if a hacker has been able to obtain someone's YouTube username and password through other means but their account is locked with 2 Factor authentication, the hacker would exploit the weak security of the users cell phone company by calling customer service and using social engineering to trick the employee into transferring the users phone number to their cell phone; so when they log into YouTube the 2 Factor security code will be sent to their cellphone. Boom access granted.    

If the cellphone customer service employee doesn't fall for the attempt to social engineer them, the hacker will just hang up and call back until they get someone in a call center who didn't take the extra time to verify the user before making the change.

At least in England there's some precedent for this. Navies are ridiculously expensive and have to paid for in actual cash, and only kings, or lords with ambition to be kings, usually have need of them. They're used for sustained campaigns on an international scale.

Armies are expensive in absolute terms, but not on anywhere near the same level. They're also a little more self-organizing. Overall they're something that is a) plausible for a lord to be able to provide, b) scalable (a lesser lord can just raise a smaller army; he can't buy a ""small warship""), c) decentralized (levies live everywhere; warships are built in special yards), and d) useful on a local scale (whereas there's no guarantee the richest lords even have sea access)."

"Exodus 21:16 doesn't distinguish between hebrew and non-hebrew, while other verses about slavery do, the only explanation for this that makes sense is that it did indeed apply to everyone.

&gt;""When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.""

The reasons for the wars were described in the Bible as being a matter of justice, rather than race. And they were given the choice between facing justice (death) or repentance (slavery).

It might be outrageous to say they were consenting to slavery in that instance, but nobody consents to time in prison either, the fact is that it was supposed to be a punishment for crime (death) but they gave them the choice to stay alive.

Now we could debate their honesty on this issue until the cows come home, but neither of us could prove either way so we only have their word to go on.

This verse was put there for dire situations in which a family was in desperate need of money. It's not supposed to be permitting a bunch of heartless parents to get rid of their child.

"The costumes in the game are relevant to the levels where they are unlocked (such as a jungle explorer costume in the jungle level, or a chef's costume in the cooking level).

But let's not lose track of *this* discussion. What we're talking about here is random cosmetics.

Anti-Church radicals included Hitler's Personal Secretary Martin Bormann, Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, paganist Nazi Philosopher Alfred Rosenberg, and paganist occultist Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler.

Their last two albums To Be Kind and The Seer are quite good.  	I guess her plan worked. Thing is, even though I'm hearing her name again, any desire to listen to her music has been obliterated. So did her plan really work?	Free world refers to the Western nations, not the US. You'd be hard pressed to say that the West wasn't free, as a whole.	"2 + 2 = 4 - 1 = 3

Quick maths."	Wow, so you're like triple neutral this year. 	You're probably thinking of Nobuhiko Takada? He had a record of 2-6-2 which is abysmal compared to how tough he was portrayed. Shibata was portrayed similarly tough and had a record of 4-11-1. Nakamura was portrayed as an MMA badass and had a record of 3-1. Kazuyuki Fujita had a record of 15-14 and literally had a head made of adamantium. KUSHIDA is actually 6-0. If I had to guess, you're thinking of Takada or Shibata. And, aside from Suzuki and Shibata, most wrestlers don't incorporate MMA into their personas in NJPW anymore because it was trying to present NJPW guys as mixed martial artists that put NJPW into such a bad financial slump in the early-mid 2000s. Notabaly, Tanahashi and Okada, their two most recent Aces, have never done any MMA.	Avoid Revolut - potentially higher fees and very dodgy stories of inbound transfers not appearing (+ being ignored by customer services).	Sounds like the mods for /r/needafriend either /r/needaclap or /r/needabeer :)	Judge was being sarcastic, and the comment makes perfect sense in the context of the judgment.

In which case though, there will be no ""it didn't fit into the plot of Deathly Hallows"" excuse."	"I never thought I'd be one to be affected by the passing of an artist that I've never met, but after having spent the past 25+ years listening to this man's voice and just assuming he would always be around to produce amazing music.

Miss you man."	"Hacking via criteria is quite common AFTER they get into the server.

See a good webservice will encrypt and salt the passwords, technical terms meaning mathematically mess it up but if you know what the password IS, and compare it to the messed up version, you know what the right version is.

So what happens is hackers get your encrypted password, then use compute power to guess billions of passwords until they get the right one. The problem is there's potentially trillions, trillions of trillions, and more, of passwords. But people tend to use the same patterns of passwords. IE ""Yourname""(some numbers) EG Megyn91. So the hacker suddenly has to guess along these password patterns, greatly reducing the amount of password guessing they have to do to get it. This is (in simplified terms) called a dictionary attack (with some rules, etc.)

So password requirement criteria is used to extend the sorts of passwords the hackers have to guess, in order to make it computationally infeasible to check. Of course the best passwords would just be a mess of random letters, numbers, and every other ASCII character out there. But that would annoy people even more, so sadly it doesn't get implemented."	There isn't a power structure that exists that someone isn't trying to use for their own benefit.	"This is why I always have a pair of googly eyes glasses in my glove compartment.

Or I play the Danny Elfman Batman theme while giving like 10 car lengths in front of me just so I don't have to use my brakes."	It can work either way, but the point of the original comment was obviously not just referring to conjunctions.	You're not too bright, are ya?	"Only Kanye would get the sort of pass this sub has given him for his recent string of idiocy. The slavery comment, the MAGA bullshit, and all the pseudointellectual nonsense that he spouts is absolutely insane. The fact that he put the doctor's face as his album cover as a form of ""forgiveness"" was fake af but this sub bought all that bullshit. Imagine if someone like Drake, Eminem or J.Cole spouted that shit.

I like literally every Kanye album, and I'll probably enjoy his new one too, but the Kanye apologism on this sub is disgraceful."	You don't. The best you can hope for is to maintain a calm and collected attitude, and let their hysterics speak for you. 	I agree that you don't need it, but when software is consumed by 85% of your population, you need to ensure consumer rights are being protected. To you, the company's liability is paramount. To others, the rights of the consumer needs to be paramount. You can probably guess what most people will side with.	I'm a big proponent of hearty meals for the munchies like OP, but I don't think I'll ever quit my occasional habit of buying a bag of doritos and inhaling the lot. It's probably just all the MSG, but that's one kind of junk food I'll never get tired of.	"You have it inverted. If they're both at f/2 they're projecting the same amount of light onto the sensor (assuming an evenly lit scene). That's why f-numbers are universal exposure between focal lengths. Only the viewing angle will change.

At the same f-number, the aperture in the 25mm will be half the diameter of the aperture on the 50mm (12.5 vs 25mm at f/2). Yet the same amount of light is reaching the sensor. The reason is the wider angle lens ""gathers"" more light.

If we use the same size aperture for both, say 25mm, now the 50mm lens is at f/2 and the 25mm lens is at f/1. That's 2 stops, or 4x the amount of light hitting the sensor."	"I'm the opposite. I don't love everything being gated behind postgame, because it feels kind of irrelevant at that point except for collectors.

Back in my day, gameplay trailers were all about gameplay, and launch trailers were posted at launch."	"Learning a discipline in a field requires real world experience. There may be a few exceptions, but you need hands-on experience before you can do the job you've studied for. If you're training to be a nurse you need to learn to interact with you patients and learn how to insert IV needles for instance.

I did attend a university and took a lot of labs. I learned how to do laboratory procedures and use all the equipment, and that prepared me for the job I have now as a lab tech after I graduated with a BS in biology. For instance, you can't learn how to use a microscope online, you need to have an actual microscope in front of you to get the feel of it and know how to properly use it. If I didn't have those labs I wouldn't have the experience they were looking for and they wouldn't have hired me.

&gt;That will never learn any of that at university. They will learn it's ok to punch people they disagree with

And this the final straw for me in this conversation. I see you're completely detached from reality and instead have created your own biased narrative of what higher education is and how it works. I can't think of one university that insists it's 'okay to punch people they disagree with'. That's just some shit that you invented out of thin air.

Mark Soloski here: We think it is because the range of the deer tick, which is the vector that transmits the disease to humans, is expanding.

If the gunman said he was doing the shooting for Trump or because (he thought) Trump told him to, then you would have an argument.

Instead you post a gif from a wrestling match (you know wrestling isn't real right?) with a CNN logo edited in and act like Trump is calling for the blood of journalists.

Most of the ""tricks"" people see elephants doing in modern zoos are behaviors that help with their healthcare (standing still, lifting a foot, opening their mouth, allowing someone to massage their trunk, allowing someone to look in their ears, etc.)

This is true for any trained animal you see in AZA zoos, but on top of that they may have other behaviors. Some important ones may be the request to come inside at once (example- someone gets into the elephant habitat, or maybe there's a venomous snake), the request to drop an object or bring it to the keeper, the request to back up or come forward, or demonstrate strength ability to monitor in case there's a sudden decrease that could indicate illness.

For some animals the additional behaviors are simply to be cute (which also has a purpose- this is a fantastic form of enrichment for them, if they already do the healthcare behaviors and the specific animal seems stimulated by diversity.) But even most of the things people see and interpret as ""the animal doing cute things"" have additional personal benefit to the individual animal, it may be something the animal just plain likes to do.

Not really, enforcers enforce the code for everyone. They keep their guys in line as well as keeping the other players in line. They keep their entire team safe.

Whereas right not everyone is almost guaranteed some sort of injury. Also, in boxing CTE is only found in 17% of boxers[1] and that has a higher risk than fighting in ice hockey. So ""damn near guaranteed CTE"" is fundamentally an overstatement. We exchange every player's safety in exchange for maybe someone gets CTE.

Being readmitted for phototherapy means the babies had jaundice. It's normal for babies who are formula fed to clear out quicker than babies who are breast fed because babies who are bottle fed (formula or pumped breast milk) tend to take in more than babies who are nursing - the milk comes out faster and other reasons. The more going through their system, the quicker the bilirubin is cleared, meaning they recover from the jaundice more quickly. 

I think the context should be added to your original post - it's a very specific circumstance (babies released with jaundice needing to be re-admitted for phototherapy) whereas your original post makes doesn't include the context and makes it seem like breastfed babies are readmitted more on the whole. 

Edit: Sorry, the above was only dealing with the second link. As for the first, take note of the conclusion

&gt;Exclusive breastfeeding and weight loss are associated with increased neonatal health care utilization. Improving clinical management of exclusively breastfed neonates with pronounced weight loss might reduce health care utilization.

Meaning, according to the study, the answer isn't to stop pushing breastfeeding, but to increase clinical management (support and information) for EBF babies. It's normal (and not concerning) that EBF babies regain weight a bit more slowly. The increase in hospital visits (notice it includes outpatient, it's not talking about admissions in this case like the phototherapy one was) could be weight checks for nervous moms whose milk hasn't come in yet - that doesn't mean there is a problem, and it certainly doesn't mean

My girlfriend got a mouse from her best friend as a birthday gift. She was so happy, and besides the fact that she adores small animals, she has had a lot of other pets growing up. Which is why her lack of responsibility surprised me.

A couple of days after she got it, she realized that the mouse was a girl - and not only that, it was also pregnant. So, in a couple of weeks, she had 4 little rodents running around the cage, and their mom as the 5th. The cage was too small for 5 pets, so she frequently let them outside to run around and explore - all under strict supervision (her words).

One night, as she woke up, she forgot that the mom mouse was out of the cage and accidentally killed it - the poor animal got stuck between the door as she was closing it. She went into a full-blown panic attack and called me in the middle of the night. I barely calmed her down and told her it was going to be okay, but to be more careful next time.

A couple of weeks later, about a week before she was supposed to give the mice to their new owners, she went for a business trip. She lives alone, so she gave the mice to her mom to take care of them for a few days. When she came back, she realized that two of them died for unexplained reasons.

When we saw each other a few days later, and I asked her about the two mice left, she said she was going to keep them. I was kinda irritated, but still did my best to keep my cool. I asked her why won't she give them away, she said that she feels horrible about what happened to the rest, and that the two left ones grew to really like her, and she grew very fond of them.

I told her not to be irresponsible because she might kill those two ones as well. She said something along the lines of ""Wow, just when I forgot about the whole thing..."" Like WTF? THREE of her pets died, and she just *forgot* about it? And now, irresponsible as she is, she'll keep the rest, even though she knows there's a chance that they'll somehow die too? I couldn't keep silent.

I told her that she needs to be more responsible. She agreed, but when I told her that maybe she shouldn't have any more pets for a while, since bad stuff happen to them, she started crying and justifying herself. Mice are living beings, she can't be so easy-going about them.

Anyways, she cried so much, and when I wanted to hug her, she got up and left. It's been hours and I still haven't heard from her. I feel kinda bad. Am I the asshole? I just wanted her to know that pets require responsibility, and to make sure that she knows what she's doing, but now I feel pretty bad.

Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind's eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father's solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage's beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool. But he had not left the Wall for that; **he had left because he was after all his father's son, and Robb's brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen.** Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well. Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man's hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, **so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother's side and help avenge his father.**

First, it's a work of fiction. I don't think anyone was proud of ostracizing the Parkland shooter. I read commentary that he was not a nice person and hadn't been for a while. It's hard to feel sympathy for someone who was pro-Nazi. Carrie is an extremely sympathetic character.

That said, sure. The quote I posted in a different place in the thread, ""A child rejected by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth,"" certainly applies in the case of the Parkland shooter, and other shooters, I don't doubt.

I think the disconnect comes from the fact that Carrie's ostracism and bullying drove her inward, and, again, a purely innocent (until the end) and sympathetic victim. That may be more true of female victims of bullying than male, who might be driven to embrace their social standing and lash out rather than turn inward.

I'll go off the linked PDF for now. I'm assuming you need to calculate the value of the formula. I'll assign names to parts: SAT = SUM 2^(var_j), where var\_j is SUM v\_(something) 2^i. Let's ignore the calculation of var\_j. It's clear that var\_j has at most 2^(number of variables) bits; since addition is O(number of bits), we have that the formula is exponential.

IIRC, Federation vs Zeon had a mission where you're a random grunt and have to recon White Base and the Gundam.

Of course you're in a freaking Zaku VS Amuro freaking Ray and the Gundam is completely invincible (as per lore at the time) and one shots you.

So basically the entire mission is you hiding scared shitless (in first person cockpit) trying to get scans while you hear your teammates die horrifically one after another while Amuro is literally counting out loud his kills, praying that Amuro doesn't appear from behind the rock you're hiding behind , shrug off all your attacks and shank your ass.

If it's a foul and they go down in the area, it's a penalty. Describing it as a dive tells me you don't think it was a foul, I wouldn't be expecting to see a foul should someone say ""he dived"". Falling over has nothing to do with whether it's a foul or not, and if they feel they can't stay on their feet safely it's not directly simulation to fall over to avoid being hurt further. There's many situations where you could say one way or the other, but I generally wouldn't consider a situation described as a dive to be a foul. Certainly you can describe it as diving, but I wouldn't directly say it was A Dive."	"Lol. ""Google it."" Next you'll tell me to be a free thinker. You have to vet your sources.

She was really taken aback and told me she thought that's what communicating/bonding was like. 

Edit: Because a few people have asked about how this interaction went down, this was with a dear friend and while she was very sweet and generally a good friend, I got frustrated that she would do this when I told her something bad or something that was troubling me, the way one would normally confide in a friend. But often her first response would be a parallel story in her life, or something tangentially related that was bad with her at the moment, and I felt as if what I had just said was less important or brushed aside or ignored. When I finally mentioned this to her, I told her it sometimes felt she was trying to say that she had it worse in some way, at which point she was confused and a little upset that it came across that way to me, because she said that was how she grew up communicating with her family. She did get a bit better about it, but it was also helpful for me to realize that she was coming from a genuine place of trying to connect rather than any sense of self-centeredness.

I don't feel insecure about it, though, and I am going to explain to you why you shouldn't either.

1. **They are her exes for a reason.** Spontaneity is all well and good, but it can be a liability in relationships. And that's just the one off the top of my head. I don't know you, or your wife, or her exes (unless by some *really* weird coincidence I happen to be friends with one or more of you), but I know that women don't look at men whom they are attracted to and could potentially settle down with and then just suddenly go ""Oh never mind I'm gonna go with someone else who is less suitable for me."" If she wanted to still be with those men, she would be. She is not. She is with you. She *chose* you. This means that you were the best choice, overall, even if that means a compromise or two had to be made. And if you're going to assume that she was somehow wrong in her analysis of your suitability, well, that's a huge can of worms that I am *not* gonna help you pack back up. ;)
2. **You can become more aggressive in the sack.** This is something my wife and I are working on. (Or, at least, we were, before we were derailed by the arrival of our first child. Hard to experiment with new sex if you're barely getting any sex.) If you're like me, it's not particularly in your nature... but if you're like me, you are still planning to give it a shot, because you love your wife more than anything, and if something would make her happy, it's worth trying for.
3. **Safety and reliability are GOOD QUALITIES**. My wife had one other major relationship before she met me. They had aggressive, animalistic sex... when he wasn't stoned out of his mind, or attempting to turn their apartment into a homeless shelter, or getting fired from jobs. *Stability matters*, because it's hard to build your life on quicksand. It's hard to go through the day when your relationship, the one thing that should be fueling you up and giving you energy, is draining you and tiring you out instead. And that's what my wife had with her ex. And that's why he's her ex. ""Fun"" and ""excitement"" are all well and good, but they don't make a home.
4. **The fact that you're not perfect is not news to her.** Trust me, she knew about your shortcomings before you guys got married. Again, she chose you. She chose you anyway. If this were really a big deal, she'd have said something before now.

Now, you have some insecurities regarding her comments. That's okay. Talk to her about it. Tell her what you overheard, and tell her that it made you feel inadequate. I am certain -- *certain* \-- that she will tell you a lot of the same things I just did. Then, take the opportunity to ask her what she'd like you to do differently, and how. Find out what she misses about the spontaneity and/or the fucking, and see if you can implement it. It may work; it may not; at the very least, it'll be fun to try.

Since no one knows what happens after we die, I don't think that claim is any better than claiming that an afterlife does exist.

I tend to think of it in same way I would for a manufactured good, where the floor is essentially the COGS. In this case, that would be whatever price was necessary to sustain the producers \- the network of miners.

I don't think it's a game of chicken. I think the large institutional investors expect the money needed to prop up the miners and the ecosystem (hardware vendors, exchanges &amp; infrastructure investors, big tech. players &amp; VCs) to flow in indirectly \- not via the BTC price but via direct investment in gear\-maker IPOs, construction of new cost\-efficient facilities, and so forth. I also don't believe they don't expect an influx of speculative money to suddenly drive the BTC exchange value up either (where would that sudden influx of money come from?), but they are watching the network for clues about when to start ramping up their accumulation. 

It was put to me this way: if you're looking for a reason for anything to change wrt the BTC exchange price, what would it be? Regulation? User adoption? Sentiment? Sure, all of those, but you also want to keep an eye on the infrastructure and supporting ecosystem.

2. For building credit, finance a portion of it on a secured credit line. You'll need to put up something to secure it, like a car title or even though this sounds weird, money. What it will do for you is build your credit and give you a much better rate on the loan. You won't be getting a motorcycle loan(lame rates anyway), you'll just be getting a secured line of credit that you can spend on whatever you want. Another strategy is you could get a secured credit card and use it to buy all of the gear you'll need for you and your new bike. It's a great credit builder, but don't take my word for it, go talk to your local bank or credit union, they are there to answer your quesetions, use the resource.

Reading advice on this thread with claims of ""$1,000 in interest"" if you finance and that's just crap.

1. Not all games supported linux at the time, so I have games that just won't run on natively Steam Machine.
2. They were actually expensive, and the majority of models were not cheap compared to just... buying any other normal PC. And by choosing parts, before the crypto-rush, building a PC was cheaper than getting a Steam Machine. (shoutout to /r/buildapc)
3. They were not available in my local stores - if I bought one, I'd have to get it shipped which would cost more and I'd have to do extra work to make sure I get warranty(if it had any). 
4. I already had a reasonable PC when they came out. 
5. They didn't update their models in years - all of the models now are using *really* old hardware. So even though my current PC is about 4 years old, a Steam Machine is... almost as old as my PC... so why would I buy a Steam Machine instead of a new PC? (when the gpu and ram prices drop unless my pc dies before that happens)
6. Lastly, when I first heard about the Steam Machines the expectations were set to be an alternative to consoles, so I figured that the machines will be a PC with some console-like features: it would have one model(or only a few) which games optimizes for, so even though the hardware isn't powerful it would still have good value. Instead, Valve out-sourced the creation to many companies and allowed each to create loads of machines, meaning nobody gets special optimization like the consoles AND they are all just as expensive as a normal PC. 

So basically, Valve gave up the possible advantages of a console-like device and it ended up just being another pre-built PC brand with no real difference between it and just any other random PC with the Steam OS installed."

Your statement ""Temasek Holdings have never made a single cent"" is a strawman argument. I don't know anyone who claims that Temasek Holdings has never made a single cent. There are several claims against Temasek Holdings

1. The financial reports are ownself-check-ownself. Lack of accountability except to the BOD. Generally this is viewed as a conflict of interest. 

2. The opaqueness of the reporting allows the company to present data selectively. It also leads to a possibility of private parties with knowledge of Temasek operations benefiting from decisions made  using public money

3. The big one in my opinion is the contentiousness of whether Temasek is using ""public money"". The reason why most people feel it is public money is that from it's inception it was given the assets previously managed by the Singapore government. The Singapore government got these assets by taxation of the general public.

4. Those that believe that Temasek is using public funds, believe there should be transparency, or at least a disclosure after a couple of years for accountability's sake - especially for example if Temasek invests in a company, but as a introductory fee, a family member gets a couple shares at a discount.

These are totally different examples - how can you conflate what is obviously a scientific fallacy, with something that it is worth having a debate over."	"&gt; Androids aren't ONLY for poor people, as that is how you worded it.

Russell's teapot is an analogy, formulated by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making unfalsifiable claims, rather than shifting the burden of disproof to others.

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.[1] He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong."

[The American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-CitzenshipQuestion.pdf) wrote to Secretary Ross (who has also expressed similar concerns) that the addition of the question would negatively impact the accuracy of the census. Now, I have a degree in social science methodology, but AMSA is a completely different level of mathematical expertise. Additionally, they rely on the accuracy of public demographic information for everything. There is no doubt in my mind, or theirs, that including the question would make the census less accurate. So, to justify the addition of the question legally, you need to justify why getting less accurate data is better than not asking the citizenship question.

&gt;the problems remains, we need to know how many illegal aliens are in our country.

The American Communities Survey asks the same questions and regularly collects the same data. The difference is that there is a better time frame to collect the data so field observers can often administer the survey itself and ensure people understand the government can't use the data to hunt them down. It is highly unlikely that many illegal immigrants will answer a census document that asks them to disclose their status without being able to ask legal questions to observers or surveyors.

If your goal is to assess how many illegal immigrants there are, the ACS does that. Thus, the legal justification to make the census less accurate is absolved.

&gt;And is it fair that areas that are heavily populated by illegal aliens get more of a voice in Washington or more government funding?

It doesn't matter if its fair, it matters what the law says. The Constitution requires an ""actual Enumeration"" of ""people,"" not citizens. If you don't like that, you should propose a Constitutional Amendment. The *American* children of illegal immigrants still go to schools and need healthcare. Moreover, illegal immigrants pay federal, state, sales, and local taxes without getting access to most state or federal entitlement benefits. Most of them are paying into a system they will never benefit from. If anything, it is unfair to exclude them from the census.

&gt;IMHO illegal alien populations should not effect things like the number of delegates a state gets, for example.

I don't know what to tell you. Your social contract says they should. They may not be able to vote, but they still live in these places and pay their taxes. What you are suggesting is taxation without representation. That seems pretty un-American.

There are ways to change how the census works, doing it maliciously and illegally seems like a hard sell to me. I'm sure the fact that some Central American people want to live in the United States infuriates you, but that isn't a reason to fuck up the census. The only reason to change the census would be to make it more accurate or fill in gaps in the ACS. This does neither."

"This is a complete incongruent reaction to reading about other's suffering but when the flagrant inadequacy of Britain's mental health services that I've experience resonate here, I feel a perverse camaraderie though mutual exasperation and despondency. 

I've been vacillating between capitulating to the exorbitant cost of private therapy or persevering with the NHS after 5 years with the perfunctory and incompetent services of healthy minds. After my initial diagnosis of severe depression and the subsequent tumultuous period of inuring my body to the effects of citalopram with a fluctuating dosage after my doctor couldn't quite discern what was appropriate, I was sent for a consultation for a therapist at my doctor's insistence. 

Healthy minds agreed that my symptoms were exacerbated by the anxiety of group sessions so they discarded that idea and thought personal therapy would be most effective in alleviating depression and assuaging any intrusive nervousness as I had a reticent disposition. I had to endure another six months before my purported referral letter arrived, that turned out to be a strange amalgam of an apology, a revoking of their previous diagnosis, and instructions to answer a weekly phone call because after meticulous reviewing, they deemed me at a low risk of suicide and thought over the phone therapy would be just as effective.

 We all know it was to mitigate expenses and allocate resources to those without an intrinsic support structure of diligent parents like I had so I wasn't too indignant at their insinuating.  

Then my symptoms compounded and my doctor had the audacity to ask if I'm going through heartbreak because he's accustom to girls conflating depression and anxiety with heartbreak; I was flummoxed! Why yes, I've been using histrionics for nine whole fucking years to elicit attention because I'm heartbroken from a fabricated relationship I've never had with an imaginary person.

I still maintain that the **""Nothing really ends""** line rebuffing Ozymandias in the end holds more power if they kept it being said by Dr. Manhattan, which is the way it was in the comics.

Coming from someone who could easily have seen the future, this would be devastating for Ozymandias.

It feels probably extremely similar to sex with a cis male penis. We use either a an inflatable implant or a semi rigid rod, which the person can get hard at times of arousal and soft when not aroused. The inflatable implant has a pump that is in place of  one of the testicles in the scrotum. It's squeezed which causes the chamber to fill with saline. This causes the erection.  The semi rigid rod is moved by hand into an erect position.
Post sex, the person uninflates or repositions the rod implant.

The postop recovery is about 90 days. It's very unpleasant for the first 5 weeks or so, and then improves over the next few weeks. By the 8th week, it is primarily a return to previous functioning, which takes place usually between weeks 8-12. For those with manual labor jobs, we prefer that they take more time off to recover, like 4-6 months, depending.

The patient has to keep the phallus elevated as much as possible over the first 90 days. That can be challenging, especially as you begin to feel better and want to be out and about more often.

Also, to not just show why the answer is wrong, I want to provide a better answer.

When you hear high-pitched ringing in your ears it is because your inner ear usually is not receiving the high level of oxygen it needs from your blood supply. The brain is not receiving a signal, and so it interprets this as ringing instead. When the oxygen returns to normal levels, your ear works again, the brain receives the signal, and the ringing goes away.

Why does this happen spontaneously? We've probably all experienced this upon standing up too quickly. The blood pressure drops and we hear ringing in our ears, as the ear doesn't receive enough oxygen briefly.

This same situation can happen spontaneously within the ear itself.  If there is an extremely minor interruption in the blood flow to even a tiny area of the ear, this will occur. This can happen just from a variance in your blood oxygen saturation (it constantly varies in our blood from 90-100% normally) or from a brief narrowing of a blood vessel from movement or vasoconstriction (which is also constantly occuring).

Combining these effects you can get a very brief and very tiny transient ischemia (low oxygenated tissue) that your brain will interpret as ringing but very quickly clears itself since it is so small and eventually equalizes.

&gt; The paper billbucket linked to clearly indicates the sounds perceived from the tensor tympani is not high pitched (and you can experience it yourself by closing your eyes very tightly, hear that roar in your ears?) and would not be related to what the OP is talking about. This is unsubstantiated conjecture that doesn't make basic sense or have any evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; billbucket's top comment in this thread is not the answer, and has no evidence backing it up. The other link billbucket used to support his theory doesn't even mention the tensor tympani and simply talks about the relationship between brief tinnitus and chronic tinnitus.

That because of this, he is not responsible for our actions despite creating us. But is this really an option? 

  
No. Even under compatibilism God would have full control of what constitutes an agent's nature. In short, he could have created men such that they always *freely* choose good things. Which there is no logical problem with. Jesus is an example of a person who always freely chose good things. Angels are beings that presumably always freely choose good things; except for that one guy who used his freedom to rebel. But in Satan's case again, God created him such that he would freely choose evil. He had full control of what constituted his nature, just like Jesus, just like angels, just like humans. So again whether or not we view it as ""robots"" or beings with free will in a deterministic universe, God is still responsible.   


There is room for randomness creating ""freedom"", but it's not clear what value randomness would be to God or how it's really 'free' in any meaningful way that would be relevant to moral responsibility.   


&gt; So my question is, what is it about our decision making process that makes us have free will, and what is it about the robot exactly that makes it so that they lack free will? 

  
Nothing if we accept compatibilism (presuming the robots are sufficiently conscious and have a ""nature"" to act according to).   


&gt; It's generally accepted that robots do not and despite future advances would not have free will.

Your map is groundwater *and* surface watersheds (creeks, rivers, ponds, and lakes). Blue is 5% or less (could even be a gain) variance while yellow/orange represent dry-year/seasonal variances (mostly over desert climates on the map). These combined are the great majority of the map.

The problem areas are violet, red, and maroon. Violet is 5-25% and is very worrisome. 25-75% just isn't even a category, either because it doesn't exist in the data or they forgot it, I don't know. The violet is an awful color, as it isn't noticable where it's blended into the blue areas. Then red/maroon are are 75%+ depletion.

The chart also has pie charts all over it, and those show the great majority of the water waste comes from surface irrigation, while household use comes in around 3-8% (guess-timates based on pie charts). 

The map/chart bothers me, because where I am is listed as blue. It's based on ""year 2005"" data. The only way to compare changes like this is to take 10-year or 20-year combined data and compare it to other 10/20-year sources to see changes over time. I don't know that this is what was done or not. 

Two years ago, the biggest lake near me was so full from rainfall in the early summer that they were having to bleed off water to prevent damage to the dams. This year by the same time we were 10-12 feet low on lake levels. Last year was just a couple feet low. But that's not a down-trending pattern because that cycle happens all the time here.

We have a huge Arctic ice melt that's been happening. The ice there isn't lasting as long as it used to. It's shrinking and getting thinner. That puts more water into the water cycle. But it also raises the Arctic temperature because there's less ice to keep the air cool. That's a real problem with long-term consequences."	"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA.

You do have a point though, and while it could be a mistranslation, it's hard to tell. What else do you think Luke could have meant?"	"Look into Scheme therapy. It could help you. 

It's about ""rewriting"" stories or schemes, templates, in your mind, your history.

* **sees the episode title** I'm going to like this episode.

* Upcoming battle and Fa wants to look pretty. I'm torn, should we get rid of her first or Katz?

* LMAO is Yazan trying to *throw out* all the Hizacks?! And then he casually slapped Jerid! I needed that laugh.

* Apart from the obvious (Bright x Burger and... that's all I can come up with), I think Jerid and green-haired lady have one of the best relationships in the series. She's always by his side to either calm him down or provide help, I like that dynamic, even if I don't like Jerid.

* Uh.. as I said that he kissed her after he brashly said ""I don't care about your circumstances"". So confessing is all it takes to completely change your opinion on the other person? I prefer them as a non-romantic duo tbh, not everyone needs to be in a relationship.

* DEATH FLAG ALERT. Green haired lady might die. I'm not sure they'd put Jerid through that again, so I'm calling a false alarm.

* Yup, Bright x Burger ship confirmed. As far as I've seen they've been carefully rationing their food, and he's all like ""yeah I'm gonna eat this burger whenever I want"". I respect that.

* So Katz has been acting like an even bigger idiot because Char isn't around? I'd be more scared of Bright's corrections than Char's.

* Yeah no shit people hate the Titans for dropping a colony. I'd be worried if they didn't hate them.

* The end was so sweet. Did those kids do a voiceover a slideshow of images? Surely they have recording devices. Anyway I'd like to hug Bright, he's so unselfish and takes on the burdens of everyone, but never asks anyone else for help. Char is the coolest, but Bright is the best character imo.

I really enjoyed this episode! Usually I don't care about the fights (not just in Gundam, in any show) but I was intently watching this one. I'd say it was because of Char but he was barely in this episode. They only gave Fa + Kamille a brief fight and then a make-up conversation, which I was grateful for.

As usual, I'm struggling with names, but typing them out does help. Not sure who the green-haired lady is or the green-haired boy that got groped for no fucking reason, but I know Yazan now.

And it sure appears like neoliberals, at least on Reddit, are trying to co-opt libertarianism. To this end, I can only conclude that not only are they not my ally, but they may very well be hostile to libertarianism as well. I don't care about feel good points, so I won't team up with someone I disagree with just to call out alt-rightist and trumpians. I criticize these factions on my own terms, independent of what some other ideology thinks. It's not gatekeeping, it's reestablishing the fundamentals of libertariansim. And for the record, there's much infighting within the libertarian community about reforming the libertarian party. I wouldn't suggest taking the LP's approach as the libertarian ""manifesto"" to how libertarians think and believe. For instance, more libertarians disapprove of candidates like [Bill Weld](https://beinglibertarian.com/5-reasons-hate-bill-weld/) then approve of them.

That's entirely possible regarding what was actually being sold, but I was basing my decision on the eventual outcome of the PS3 vs Xbox 360 debate which flipped from 360 to PS3 sometime around 2012 or so for me.

Because of that the Xbone may have technically been able to be the better launch console but I already knew the PS4 was the better long term console for me.

I am talking about contractual pensions that are agreed upon ahead and a clearly laid out contract is signed by both parties. This agreement has stipulations based on conduct while in the course of completing the requirements of the job. If someone were to deliberately break that contract by say, raping children you were employed to care for, you no longer qualify for the benefits of employment if the contract stipulated no rape.

If you disagree and think that an employee should still get their pension, I would like a better argument than other people get their 401k even if they break the law. It's a completely different contract and if child rapists want to have a comfortable retirement they should try harder to not get caught or have a contract that doesn't say your pension is dispersed after review based on several criteria including the PPA(Pension Protection Act). This Act is there to protect employees from companies fraudulently withholding pensions but has clear cut stipulations on why and how this can be done.

"&gt;because the Forsaken have better claims for calling it theirs than anyone

People constantly say this, but it's so painfully untrue.

There are Lordaeron human survivors. Lordaeron is rightfully *theirs*. Their loyalties and affiliations are and always were to Lordaeron and the Alliance/Argent Dawn/Scarlet Crusade.

The Forsaken are nothing more than invaders and conquerors. Lordareon DID belong to them, but then they died, were risen as mindless soldiers of the Scourge, fought against and destroyed Lordaeron, broke free, re-conquered Scourge/Scarlet-owned Lordaeron, and joined the Horde. They went Alliance of Lordaeron -&gt; Dead -&gt; Scourge -&gt; Forsaken -&gt; Forsaken Horde.

If he did not plan/""intend"" for me to raise my right hand, I wouldn't have done it. He did not control me to take that action, but it was still all part of the plan. Everything would be part of the plan, because he planned everything. I am in control of myself, but my actions were still intended to happen and planned for. Do you know why he could do that? Because he's omniscient and omnipotent. It has everything to do with being all-powerful and all-knowing. If my actions weren't intended, then he is not all-powerful/knowing. If he is not all-powerful/knowing, then he could not have intended my or anyone else's actions, and would not be worth talking about.

Not everything has to be a Murdoch conspiracy theory. 

""Homeless"" means you don't have a home to sleep in. You could be couch surfing, sleeping in your car, in a refuge or sleeping on the street (sleeping rough). You can be homeless without sleeping rough 

""Sleeping rough"" means you're sleeping on the streets. It's a subset of being homeless. 


 http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/39140850

&gt;Being homeless doesn't always mean that someone is living on the streets.
A homeless person could be staying temporarily on a friend's sofa or living in temporary accommodation provided by a local charity or the council.

&gt;sleeping is a type of being homeless.
If someone is rough sleeping, this means they have absolutely nowhere to stay, so have to find themselves somewhere to sleep at night - often on the streets or in empty buildings."

It modifies core game code; therefore, it is a mod. Simple as that.

Other client-side mods are absolutely not ""stuck back there""; PvP mods like 5zig and Better PvP are released with support for both older and newer Mojang versions. LabyMod is released only for older Mojang versions (1.7 and 1.8), and isn't being released for newer Mojang versions -- not because they are ""stuck back there,"" but because nobody's PvPing on the newer versions because they find the newer ones to be a lot better. On top of that, many players make custom client-side mods for specific PvP gamemodes that they maintain themselves.

There are few patches to old Mojang versions of Spigot and Paper because those releases have seen years' worth of patches. It's entirely believable that there simply aren't many bugs left to fix, and certainly no big ones.

Hypixel and Mineplex are not moving away from 1.8, and Badlion isn't moving away from 1.7. Those devs have embraced those platforms and are continuing to support them.

Development moves forward, yes, but what does ""forward"" mean exactly? Developers are continuing to build new experiences on top of a stable platform with features that players have come to expect, rather than garbage like parrots and llamas. In my view, the development on PvP servers has moved the Minecraft community forward. Just because said development isn't happening on the newest Mojang version doesn't make it backwards development.

""Development moves forward"" means that development should add features that make the game more interesting and enjoyable to individual players. If parrots are interesting and enjoyable to you, great; Mojang is moving development forward for you. But for players like me and for players like PvPers, Mojang is idle, and third parties are what really keep development moving forward. Just because it doesn't have a shiny Mojang 1.12 on it doesn't mean that it's moving backward."	Thanks!

"The benefits trap can compound horribly if you're in supported housing. The house I was living in was bought by someone who handed it to a housing association, and I saw a lot of people pass through in the time before I moved. My rent was fixed, so it was a while until I saw a breakdown of what supported tenants were paying (or rather, their housing benefit was being charged for) - often between £600-£800. If you get a job, they start charging you rent proportionately, and I don't mean that as an *affordable* proportion. It would quickly scale up to the previously mentioned amounts, presumably to force people to move out, but that's a tall order when you can never save for a deposit/fees because you're handing them all your money. I never saw any of the promised support in finding employment be delivered, but people did manage to find work from time to time, and it proved to make their life harder very quickly because of the sudden, massive financial responsibilities.

It gets worse: many of the reasons someone might be in supported housing also mean they might not be able to hold down a job very long, and upon losing employment, delay in reapplying for benefits (and one housemate was a chef, so knew he'd find a job in a week or two). Thing is, the only support I ever did see being delivered was leniency when it came to benefits sanctions, help navigating the system, etc... *when people were on benefits*. They couldn't/wouldn't do jack shit if you weren't. So those few days between someone losing their paycheck and signing on again? £600+ rent still ticking up. They go into arrears, get evicted, have no money to pay private rental fees, and end up in emergency accommodation for it to start all over again (now with a huge chunk of debt and none of the resources to appeal against it).

You do know that a ""need"" is not a ""right"", right? There's a thin line between generosity and altruism, but a huge difference in their respective outcomes when expressed politically.

Also whenever the US pulls back from ""policing"" the world to protect its interests and the interests of its allies, it creates a power vacuum and then the government is vilified for not stopping the next genocidal massacre.

So, you want the US government to safeguard the entire planet to ensure the continuation of economic globalization so you can buy cheap goods, but not use any force against those countries that murder their own peoples or others.

&gt;Does your ""highest corporate tax rate"" include the tax refunds that the corporations get?

Due to Trump's recent tax law, the US no longer has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Instead of being mad at corporations, why can't you be happy that the US workers are now more competitive in the world? 

Also, you do realize that tax refunds mean that producers are allowed to keep more of the wealth that *they created*, right?
Who are you to determine what someone else's ""fair share"" of taxes is? How many jobs have you ever created? Have you ever even tried to start your own small business?

&gt;The ""free stuff"" will be paid for by taxes, just like they are now.

Except taxing at too high a rate causes producers to leave, so you have to raise taxes on those producers that remain, which creates a downward spiral that leads to productive people leaving states like CA and NY, which decreases the tax base further.

&gt; Only now the corporations get the majority of the benefits.

Right, but who is to say every point of connection is a positive influence? There's a reason this post contained the disclaimer:

&gt;WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide

Pre-2000s maybe we looked around and thought, *everyone around me seems less down than I am in general, I should figure out what is going on and try to work out of this funk...*


But then you got on 4chan the first time and discovered that there's an epidemic. Now maybe there's less motivation to work on the issues leading to ideation/depression because previously they seemed like barriers to connection but in a digital setting everything no matter how grim or bad is a means of connecting with others. 


If you feel isolated, maybe the internet is an enabler. Maybe someone who is depressed and seeking human connection cannot bring themselves to work on the one thing that allows them to keep connecting with others (so they think), suicidal depression. So instead of thinking of it as an illness, it becomes an identity.


That is the premise of my question, maybe using technology to connect humanity absolutely to whatever end is not a good thing. Maybe we need to become aware that just because you are one way and can find others that are the same way, does not make it healthy to be hate posting over at /r/The_Donald or /b/ while loathing in suicidal depression. That's all technically what you are describing, connecting with others, but without the things that traditionally govern healthy interaction such as social normative behavior, cultural values, empathy etc. all of that gets removed online and re-created via systems like Reddit's mod/karma system, but its far from human...

I am going to argue fervently that in the general case of connected technology the end did not justify the means. For every positive interaction via the internet there are a dozen that are purely cancerous. And I think the socio-political climate in America repute with hate speech, racist political leadership, fake news etc. is the case study, enabled at least in part, by facilitating and empowering the wrong types of connections. Another case in point is the flat earth/anti-vax movements. Those are only possible via connected technology that allow disparate collections of mental illness to self-validate and organize.

Nowhere in history did the nazis execute socialists. Also, wages were not cut within Germany, they were cut in occupied countries as the war progressed.

Hitler wanted to have:

-privatization of state industries (private sector owning the means of production)

-autarky (a closed economy)

-tariffs

-no unemployment (practically had it by 1938)

-less materialism

-nationalization of corperations

-The state is charged first for the livelihood and way of life for citizens

-no more unearned income (inheritance, property, welfare, or anything that wasn't worked for by the earner)

-division of profits of all heavy industries

-state regulated income

-Everyone does the job they are best at, with unwanted jobs for slave labor

-environmental and animal rights

-Against work and labor unions

-state owned/regulated news and media

-low tax with high employment and war-gains to fund the military

Hitler wasn't a full fledged socialist, but he was a national socialist. National socialism is a mixture of socialist and fascist values. It is a more refined, leaning to the right version of normal socialism, while communism is leaning to the left. Both fascism and communism evolve from the system of socialism.

TL;DR Hitler is not a socialist by categorization, but calling Hitler a socialist is not an incorrect platform of the system he utilized and stayed within. He is a type of socialist, but his beliefs do not define socialism as a whole.

Edit: the only change I've made is ""workers owning the means of production"" to ""private sector owning the means of production"". Hitler's Germany allowed people to own their own businesses, but would reward those who aided the country the most, mainly military focused factories. It's not quite government owned like socialism, but it is heavily government aided when deemed beneficial.

They eat dinner together, they vacation together, etc. First off, Suter basically only plays with Spurgeon. They tried to play him with both Brodin and Dumba, but he complained. He didn't like that Brodin played his off hand and probably just didn't want to deal with Dumba's growing pains. Instead they leave it up to early 20s Brodin to deal with early 20s Dumba while he figures his shit out, all the while trying to figure his own game out. Then there is Suter's average ice time, which is consistently way too fucking high. They start him in 3v3 OT, despite him being one of our slower D-men. Also, the guy is super-glued to the 1st PP unit. He basically always gets the nod for any and every situation, despite maybe not being the best option. People bitch about Brodin's shit point production, but I really believe Suter is indirectly to blame for this. Brodin gets saddled with Dumba, he gets very little PP time, and is stuck behind a guy who never gets off the fucking ice. Lastly, Mike Yeo publicly complained about the vets not respecting him/stepping up/causing a divide, then the guy loses his job later that season. Maybe thanks to Suter, maybe not.

Having CMC, Mixon, and Howard gives you three top 15 RBs. You also have two stud WRs and a terrific WR3 in Corey Davis, so I think the value there exceeds the value of having Tate. Cook, Ajayi, and Tate all have downsides too. 

- Cook will get the volume and the opportunity, and he will be catching passes, but he's coming off that ACL which doesn't mean he's just an instant success, like there could be some caution and limited use when he returns. Not to mention, Latavius Murray proved effective last year and could easily steal some valuable touches near the goal line. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, their o-line is really banged up and already shaky as is, so his efficiency could really struggle especially if they turn him into the focal point of the offense. 
- Ajayi has never proven himself as a workhorse back, and with Sproles, Smallwood, and Clement still alive I don't know the extent to which he will step up this year. He's a really boom/bust guy who doesn't score much and is frequently injured. 
- Tate is 30, on a team with a lot of mouths to feed in Tate, Jones Jr., Golladay, Kerryon Johnson, LG Blount, and Riddick. He'll do fine especially in PPR, but he has a limited ceiling because of the lack of TDs and the fact that he's not going to be getting any better or anything. 

CMC and Howard are both great this year. CMC will be the focal point of the offense and will see tons of volume, especially in the passing game. In PPR he's super valuable. Meanwhile, Howard was just announced as a three down back in an offense that likes to throw the ball, suggesting that Cohen won't be the problem we previously thought and he'll remain a workhorse back in an improved offense, even seeing increased targets. Terrific RB1/2 duo to couple with Mixon. "	"&gt; What truth are you seeking with this “proof” you need?

I didn't state that arguments for papal *primacy* didn't exist until the 19th century. I said that infallibility wasn't a thing until then. Popes throughout history have tried claiming some form of supremacy over the Church, and have always been shut down by the rest of the patriarchs. But the egotism of Rome leads them to profess that it magically wasn't the other 4 patriarchates who were right, but rather the one man standing on a hill shouting for power...while ironically claiming to be ""Catholic"". Somehow the entire Catholic church, even the monophysites, have NEVER accepted any of the current claims of Rome, but were to believe the claims of this one bishop over the rest of Christendom......wow.   
St Pope Gregory had some choice words about anyone who tried to do just that.            
     
There isn't a single piece of actually evidence to support any of your claims. Claiming things requires proof. You can say until you're blue in the face that the pope had special powers (to ratify councils lmao) but there isn't any evidence to even begin to show that. Leo didn't even attend Chalcedon, but were supposed to believe it wasn't authoratitave without him...because that makes sense. He's so powerful and important, yet can't be bothered to even show up despite bishops from all around the known world were attending. Just like every single other council. The irony of bringing up Chalcedon is that the emperor refused to even hear Leo. Leo had been asking for a council to be called for years but kept getting told ""no"" by Theodosius II.  
Some universal and supreme pope, amirite.    
And I guess that means that all the declarations that affirmed and ratified contract at subsequent councils we're just all the other bishops pretending to be little popes themselves.    
   
Councils were held that specifically dealt with the problems developing in Rome (Quinisext, Eighth Ecumenical Council) but rather than having humility and accepting that the declarations of THE ENTIRE CHURCH outside of Rome *might* have some weight, Rome would rather stick their fingers in their ears and shout ""nope"" while claiming to be heroic.

"	"I use jQuery still, and I work for a lot of really big clients. I think the main appeal with jQuery is firstly the ecosystem - it's been around so long that there's an answer for how to do anything imaginable. There are also probably more plugins for jQuery than there are apps for iOS, so ""there's a plugin for that"" is a big one.

Secondly, it's super mature and stable. It's as reliable as you can get, and it's also pretty lightweight.

Third, a lot of front-end CSS frameworks use it already, such as Materialize.css and Bootstrap, as well as major platforms like Wordpress. It's just already in or required by so many things.

Those are the big points. Anyone who says ""nobody uses jQuery anymore"" is being an elitist hipster. That's not to say there aren't better frameworks, or the others don't have their place. I LOVE React and Vue and wish I could use them at work sometimes. But, they don't really fit into every scenario (or many scenarios in my situation at work), and it depends on what you're doing on a project.

I'm definitely not crowning jQuery the king, it's just that it's the right tool for the job in more of the most common situations that I'm in daily. Choosing the right tools for the job at hand is half of the development battle, and I don't do my personal projects the same way I do my work projects because they're completely different situations and types of projects. I use Vue and Material Design for personal projects, jQuery and Bootstrap at work."	"TJ and Ludwig.

*[citation needed]*"	"TIFU. The clock had just ticked over to the am hours of the next day as a friend of mine and I were coming out of a nightclub. Sweaty, drunk and unsatisfied with the music choices we were waiting on the side of the road for our Uber home. 5 minutes had gone by and we we'd moved to be able to get into the Uber safely about 50 metres away where there was no traffic. Just chatting absolute shit, I decided to charge at my friend like a bull, for what reason? Purely drunken entertainment. Head down, arms behind my back, I was even doing the footwork that accompanied what you could call about to be an expensive performance. The first time I did this, we lost the plot. Collapsing on the side walk we were in fits of laughter. Next thing I see is 3 police officers heading towards our direction. Their first words were 'Sit down now!' all in an obvious attempt at a power display and usually a necessary action for drunken idiots. Now it being quite coincidental, both of our fathers have at some stage been a cop - mine previously for 18 years, his even longer and still currently. So with the utmost respect for the profession, the fact that these cops were trying to physically put themselves above us, meant that my drunkard ass wasn't buying into it. Refusing to sit down, which in my mind I was fair to do so, as we had done nothing wrong meant that the cops were out to get me. Now we were heading home, the night was ending, the cops could have told us off with a warning saying we were being a public nuisance and it would have had the same affect. But because my drunkard ass refused to sit down I have now been arrested and questioned on the side of the road across from the nightclub. 15 minutes later and a $756 fine for being a public nuisance meant that I had just had the most expensive night out of my life for charging at my friend like a bull and refusing to sit down. I am just waiting to review the footage with a magistrate, meaning that I must travel over an hour to dispute it as I know there was no one being disrupted or were to be, and the police were just trying desperately to make quotas. 

TL;DR 

My friend and I had just come out of a night club. I charged at him like a bull a few times, for the sole purpose of entrainment; however, the police didn’t think so and issued me a $756 fine for being a public nuisance because I refused to sit down when demanded to - Which might I add I am perfectly righted to reject.

Which is to say, of course not beta this year, but the progress (while excruciating) has been steady since like .58 or so and then went to spikes and dips with .60 to now. Even got some added goodies (implementation TBD of course) like mantling and zeds that'd break down doors instead of not colliding with them.

Now it's no heli, no bows, definitely no mantling, no infected hordes breaking down the door you quickly ran into, can't even get half the firearms that already existed in standalone back into it, and grenades got 86'd.

I got into DayZ only from standalone, didn't start in the mod but very early in the standalone. I figured the game would release, eventually, and 'feature complete' only in a sense of being roughly 1:1 with content and features from legacy standalone versions, just remade in/with/to use the various shiny new .6x architecture.

I thought by having basically no expectations and entirely divorcing myself of any concept of a timeline, I had removed my ability to be disappointed by whatever came out, based on what I had already played of standalone. I expected modding to supplement that, but the fact that modders are expecting documentation and support to be of any better quality or consistency than literally any other aspect of this entire iterative game design process, I think the DayZ fans who are into prog and mod design are going to be even more disappointed."

Even Nixon worked across the aisle surprisingly often and made undeniablely good decisions for America, even if he was a paranoid crook as well.

Trump on the other hand is a being of pure spite. He's a middle-finger from half of America to the other half. The people that put him in the white house are proud that they were able to come together to give us such an incompetent, dishonorable, intentionally divisive president just because liberals told them it would be a bad idea.

Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more humans, usually as an offering to a deity, as part of a ritual. Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history. Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods, spirits or the deceased, for example as a propitiatory offering or as a retainer sacrifice when a king's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting.

Win what?"	"So, the investors I speak with are looking to do one of two things -- buy to flip, or buy to rent. According to the California Association of REALTORS (who did a survey on investment activity in 2017), investment activity is up. But, it still lags far behind normal residential activities.

Honestly though, the real problem investors are facing right now is that it's *hard* to buy a house. There are multiple offers on most really nice houses (that would be suitable to rent out), and multiple offers on the really low end/beat up houses that could be fixed and flipped. Add to that FHA appraisals being tight lately, and investors most investors aren't doing a huge amount of business.

BTW, you can see the CAR report here: https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Industry-360/PDF/Market-Data/Surveys/2017-Investor-Survey.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C3006F74E3BFAC37662A901B38EF0656C6171C93

From my own experience, most people who call themselves ""investors"" are a waste of time. The really good investors will add value and look at long term gains. Then there are the ones who'll see a house that has huge potential, and want me to write an offer $80,000 below market value in an area that has a rising market. Then, get surprised when I refuse to write it.

If you're thinking of doing real estate investment, I'd be happy to put you on the right path, but, there's a lot to consider.. There's a fair amount of cash involved upfront, FHA 90-day flip rules will slow your flip down and cost you extra money, appraisers are hesitant to appraise your newly fixed up flip for $100k more just 90 days later, etc.. And, if it doesn't sell right away, you may have issues getting your price.

On the rental side, it's easier to make money -- but, you do have to worry about tenants not paying or damaging the property. No matter how good your background checks are, someone will slip through and cause you huge headaches. But, IMHO, if you can afford multiple rental properties, you can do very well."	After these threats from the 'grand master 14D chess player', not sure if Kim will be ready to give up his nukes!	That performance by Maryland is not a good for Texas' quality loss. 	The same is true about the Spanish accents (to an extent): Spaniards would make their way south, then sail to the Canary Islands, and eventually make it to the Americas.

It's orders of magnitude. Wonderboy look's way more proficient in the exact same style, except he fights people who are actually world class (similar to Loma). So comparing him to Loma in terms of domination of opponents I can see, but in terms of quality of opponent or impact on the sport; not even close.	"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"	I think you're assuming that I'm arguing against what he's saying, which I'm not. I'm arguing against his delivery. I thought I made that pretty clear. To attack his delivery is the specific intent of the argument.	This is ugly, but, the ugliest???	"""He wears a live rattlesnake as a condom."""	"I would think this would be a function of ""street smarts"" vs analytical intellect, as well as who is providing the correcting information.  "	"The various suffragettes spanning the last couple of centuries (e.g., Susan B. Anthony and E. C. Stanton), Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughn (check with your caretaker if you're allowed to watch the film Hidden Figures for more info on these), any number of winning sports teams, legal teams, etc. Media empires.

Anyway, that it's easier to name groups of men in this exercise only illustrates how pervasive institutional sexism is and always has been, but, frankly, you're not very smart, and I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain this to you or listening to your stupid rebuttals. Stick to video games and your court mandated psychiatric regimen, buddy. I seriously doubt you've got anything useful to say on the subject of accomplishments, having none yourself, beyond however long it's been since you've re-offended."	"&gt;and no team has ever won a superbowl because they have the best defensive end but a crap QB

As a Panthers fan I would love for this to be true, but unfortunately the Broncos in 2015 kinda shatter this statement."	Then why is it hard for you to believe that some 8 year olds might have opinions that are at least as well considered as many adults who have no problem expressing *their* opinions?	In any other country than America, behaviour like this would be seen as mental illness. 	This happens a lot and people usually don't know why. It's because it looks bad for the store's numbers if they price drop something, so they keep it at full price forever and it doesn't really affect their numbers that way.	Ehrmagrd, Instagrm?	Russians have undermined our cryptocurrency markets. 	"Still thinking about the shit that Smith knows about him after seeing his ""I'll take everyone down with me"" text. I'm assuming other coaches have some dirt hidden as well. One thing's for sure, it'll be interesting. "	It's less about your country than who you choose as your face to the world. Of course people will be mocking Trump, he's such an easy target. And yeah, I'd argue he is definitely your national embarrassment. 	I'm amazed at some of the posts that get deleted and some that get retained on /r/nba sometimes.	"&gt; if Trump is tossed out

Oh man, my pants started to get *real* tight there for a minute. "	"I don't get it, if the cheats cost more than what you could ever possibly get out of crates, how can you make this argument?

Plus buying the game again when they get banned. "	The world is always evolving, and cryptocurrency it's part of it.	I just got magically taken to mount Olypus, and Baccus took time out of his drunken orgy to tell me that Jesus never existed. Checkmate, monotheists!	"&gt; VOTE DEMOCRAT!

DRUMPF IS FINISHED!!!11"	The title is intentionally misleading. Rubber bullets and tear gas caused most of the casualties.	Complete with cat friend! I dig! 	"[Archive.is link](https://archive.is/2020/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/22/lawmaker-quits-race-after-daughter-says-he-molested-her-more-than-decade/)

""My mind warp and bends...""

noice."	&lt;3	Having one class a day, even if it's for years, honestly isn't enough by itself to make you a native-level speaker. Maybe they didn't care enough to really immerse themselves until they were older. Maybe their teacher wasn't great. Maybe the way the classes were taught didn't resonate with them. Learning another language is really hard, even if you have access to classes. 	"It would be 12% higher than expectations actually. You need to take the ratio of the two.

Not sure why you think there's a debate going on, I just contextualized your comment."	Meh. A dying enterprise, (NFL), squeezes more dough out of a new sponsor. In 20 years, the NFL will be as relevant as WBC boxing is now.	"I'm sure the internet will be exploding about it, if it ends up happening. Pretty much any gaming website/subreddit will be talking about it. 
 
The rumor comes from the fact that Nintendo filed a trademark for ""Nintendo 64 Classic"" in Europe recently :O"	"I was there as well, but sitting with my dad in his season ticket seats in what is now the student section of the Upper West side of the stadium.

So despite all of the blown leads under James Franklin in the last few years, I can at least say to myself that watching any of those games is still better than sitting through another 6-4 loss game."	I mean, it's kinda not theirs anymore...	The only way to get past 4000 with actual food is to incorporate very sugary and fatty deserts.   	It is, but I didn't think it mattered. I was awed when I saw it. It was simply technically perfect in every way. The stargate sequence is in my opinion the greatest scene in all of movie history. It is just a beautiful, awe-inspiring movie that truly feels epic IMO.	https://media.giphy.com/media/nuaHpY2Y93up2/giphy.gif	"You can get limited slip as an option but it costs $3000.

http://www.2addicts.com/forums/showthread.php?t=982939"	"There are a few different forms of etiquette when it comes to elevators and it really boils down to the following: If you give a crap about the person's opinion of you, let others out first.

I typically keep the door open and let everyone out first if the lift is not too busy, otherwise airline rules apply (i.e. closest to the door first). "	"For me it was there but without a thumbnail and instead said ""Coming Soon"", but I was able to click it and watch it still."	"You're not wrong, but you're not completely right either . The type of processing matters, but it varies across foods too. Some might be more nutritious fresh, some frozen and some canned. As an example, frozen vegetables are often blanched briefly to kill any pathogens on them. This generally means they have a lower vitamin C content as compared to their fresh counterparts.

Of course, as you said with regard to the farmer's market, if you can get your hands on produce you know is extremely fresh, that's probably best."	"Knowing nothing about Mexican politics, and not caring enough to research it, I don't care if a Communist, Monarchist, or National Socialist (the NSMAP?) runs the place, just as long as they squash the cartels and end corruption.

Much of the poverty in Latin America is because of corruption in the governments, and not colonialism (as American leftists believe)."	 Gary Neville is insightful but he was a huge asshole commentating. Calling the Uruguayan's hyenas, being pretty obnoxious about Muslera's mistake, and then slagging off Jimenez for passion for his country. Like seriously? If England had that passion for playing for the national team maybe they'd have won a world cup in the last 50 years, why are you criticizing that? 	Even four grand a month is far more than enough for some parents to rent out their child for masturbatory material.	"Time for all the great scripts to be completely censored!

Microsoft is just killing things one at a time. "	"Is that a lot?

I mean, obviously it is a lot, but I have no frame of reference."	I used to rock that [Nintendo game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo!_Noid).	"This is why a lot of military folks shake their heads when terms like ""police sniper"" are used.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing about his shooting position constitutes ""cover,"" ""concealment"" or ""stable firing platform.""

&amp;#x200B;

He'd have been far better served just lying on the floor behind a corner."	Immigrants, driving around listening to their raps and shooting all the jobs. 	Sugar is good for you.	"Democrats do the same thing.

For example?

Edit: :::Crickets:::"	"Did you even read my comment? Go back and look at it. I said ""This is the one thing I love about the Trump presidency.""

*THE ONE THING*. One. Thing. 

Nothing in my comment was about liberal tears. My comment was about Trump doing things the left doesn't like, which will hopefully teach people on the left that restricting executive power is a good thing. I want liberal presidents to have limited power, just like I want conservative ones to have limited power. That's the entire point of my comment.

This is a great example of an otherwise reasonably intelligent person becoming a complete fucking moron because of politics. Your understanding of my point was miles removed from what I actually wrote, all because you wanted me to be an evil conservative villain that you could bash for karma. Wake up, dumbass, you're living in a bubble."	"So, you cannot imagine any way that a US President can exert influence short of a military invasion?

You are Dick Cheney, and I claim my $5 prize!"	This song was some great social commentary on the plight of the Aboriginal people in Australia, and a call to give them back their land. 	"What. THe. Fuck.

I've not heard of this. Did they catch the sick fuck? Article doesn't say."	Well, nothing in the Bible says to take everything literally. That's why Judaism is much more flexible, and quite honestly has a lot more atheists, we recognize its man made for the most part. But there are fundamentalists in every group.	Surprisingly enough, the Verge's review (in my opinion) was pretty good. The quality of their videos varies wildly between their journalists though, so it's not too surprising.	Sure. Is that strange? When I was a kid, mannequins scared the shit out of me. And SEARS seemed to have more in my opinion. 	My wife likes to change names to things that sound similar, then change them some more. First, she changed his name to crispy cornhole. Then to trispy tornhole.	Iron Druid is pretty mediocre and is worse with each book. I would suggest Alex Verus series that Jim Butcher himself recommends. THere's also pretty good Peter Grant series, and Night Watch by Sergey Lukyanenko.	I mean, they're probably being paid by the manufacturer or insurance company.	"That sounds like a dream. I would watch *so* much more MLB if that were routinely the case for baseball. 

Currently I'll watch the odd out of market M's game (like 20 per year), but otherwise I just can't until the playoffs are around the corner. 

There's too much other interesting stuff on TV, and elsewhere for me to dedicate this much time to baseball."	Looks like /u/AchromaticSky has this well in hand. :D	"You know when your dog savagely tries to eat your food off your plate when you've left it on the table for a brief moment?
That's what these type of people remind me of. "	"&gt; Sorry I'm not in the mood for a ping pong discussion of arguments about apple products, done this a hundred times. Nothing comes of it, It's just a way to chat and pass the time.

That's some fucked up shit. There's people on the other end of the keyboard dude.

Don't be a misanthrope."	Until others (hopefully) come forward.	"Find a radio station that plays modern ""rock"" music on a regular rotation in your area that doesn't rely on hits from the 70-2000's to make up the majority of their music. I bet for most people it's not common."	The point they're trying to make is that encouraging them to give up on aspirations to learn a marketable trade and instead go massively into debt for a piece of paper is part of the problem. If a student wants to be a mechanic, they can make good money being a mechanic. Not everyone needs to go to college.	Hart is solid. Proved it in college for 4 years, and proving it at the NBA level. Would hate to see him leave. Reliable 3, strong to the basket and can absorb contact and create space, and a guard that can basically guard 4's in short durations. 	Get a used GPU like a 960 - $150 gets you 1050 Ti levels of performance.	Even though we're trash, you all still talk about us.	"&gt; Signing for a credit card purchase is basically unheard of these days.

I had no problems at all with this in Scotland or England. I used Apple Pay as much as possible, but for the odd place that didn't accept contactless or had a hard-coded threshold, they just looked surprised for a moment when their terminal spit out a signature slip and then handed me a pencil (most of the time) meaning we were both equally out of our element."	"The consistency of posts like yours and entire subreddits almost exclusively dedicated to shitting on brown people (thinly disguised as Islam bashing) proves you wrong.

Get fucked."	"Damn, pro sports is the best trash talk you have?

""HA you live in a place with a smaller population than mine!"""	Sure, good way to experiment a bit with silhouette.	"\*sigh\*

"Lets look at the data in the link shall we? According to the latest data in Europe saloons are 45.8% of the market, in 2008 they were 56.3%. 45.8/56.3 = 0.813, AKA, saloons today only sell 81.3% as well as they did 10 years ago. 

Wagons were 13.5% in 2008, but today they are only 10.7%. 10.7/13.5 = 0.7925, or in other words, Wagons sell only 79.25% as well as they did 10 years ago. 

So essentially, wagon popularity actually declined more percentage wise than sedans did. In fact, look at the data again, wagons peaked in 98, 99 when they cracked 14%. They have been slowly going down ever since. 

As for the Audi, I was talking about the US market as that's what the GQ guy was probably talking about, where the only wagon for sale is the A4 allroad. But the numbers don't lie, wagons are declining in Europe too, and considering that the A4 allroad appeared in 2009, I think Audi realized the decline of wagons and introduced crossover models to try to slow the decline. 

Whereas in the US, wagons were never popular in the first place, and every attempt to make them viable mass market sellers seems to have fallen flat. "	[[Tree of Redemption]], the most iconic Green Mythic ever printed.	"[Archive.is link](https://archive.is/2020/https://i.redd.it/sm38h6awwiu11.jpg)

“In court last week, Badway said Bobbitt stole from the couple and received at least $200,000 of the funds since the couple set up the GoFundMe page for him last November. McClure, a receptionist, and D'Amico, a carpenter, have said they were wary of giving Bobbitt large sums of money because they feared he would spend it on drugs.”
“Bobbitt's attorneys say he has received closer to $75,000, including the cost of the camper and an SUV, both since sold.”"	In my extensive experience with marijuana, never once have I felt any sort of pain releif from it.

In the mood for high fantasy now, so I'm picking between Baptism of Fire by Andrzej Sapkowski, Mistborn or Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderon, and a reread of the Farseer series by Robin Hobb. I want to read Hobb's newest trilogy, but it's been a long time and I want to go back but don't really feel like embarking on a six book slog to get to the three I want to read. Might just skip them and jump into it. 

Probably going to go with **Baptism of Fire, by Andrzej Sapkowski**."	Again, I've never said that at all. Just that Dodger stadium isn't one I'd visit in the away garb because I've heard far too many stories (like this) of people having a bad time there.

This gives you a precision of 90% or so. That means, if you get flagged as positive, you have a 10% chance of being innocent.

If there are 100 people who are negative, the precision increases to almost 99% (1% chance of being innocent, compared to 0.02% if the FPR were 2% instead.) That's better than you can get with evidence in most simple cases. It's still huge, but the background rate (the prior) modulates it.

The problem is, the majority of people are usually innocent.

Worth a read. The indictment, in the least, demonstrates a full-on Russian conspiracy directly linked to the Trump campaign. There's no denying it.

---

James Dunlap - July 13 at 5:52 PM ·

Ok, so I've actually sat down and read the entire 29 page Mueller indictment against the 12 Russian intelligence officers, and it is totally insane. I literally can't believe the scope of this thing. I'm making this status public (i.e., shareable), because people need to know about this shit. There is no way you can read the actual indictment and not conclude that 1) there WAS a RUSSIAN conspiracy, 2) that the scope of that conspiracy was GARGANTUAN, 3) that it was organized BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT [i.e., there's no way Putin didn't know about this], 4) That people connected to the Trump campaign [and, shockingly, other U.S. Gov't officials] WERE INVOLVED, and 5) this is just the beginning. If Mueller has already uncovered this amount of information with such specificity regarding the goings-on in far-away Russia, there's NO WAY some serious shit isn't going to hit the fan going forward right here in the U.S.

So, without further ado, here are the highlights:

Article 1 of the indictment states that the Russian government actively set up multiple intelligence units (known as the GRU) with the sole aim of interfering with the 2016 election. Two of these units, 26165, and 74455, were specifically tasked with acquiring and releasing stolen documents via hacking.

Article 2 specifically calls this a ""conspiracy"" and states that the 12 indicted Russians had contacts with ""persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury.""

Article 3: The aforementioned Russian intelligence units deliberately targeted the Clinton campaign.

Article 4: They deliberately targeted the DNC as a whole.

Article 6: In June of 2016, they released TENS OF THOUSANDS of hacked documents using fictitious online personas.

Article 10: One of the intelligence officers, Boris Antonov, oversaw a department within 26165 tasked with hacking the U.S. military, governmental (i.e., political) and non-governmental organizations. [i.e., they were spying on every level of our gov't].

Articles 12-18: The Russian hackers often used various online aliases, both male and female, such as (but not limited to) ""Kate Milton,"" ""James McMorgans,"" and ""Karen Millen."" Sergey Morgachev, another Russian hacker, was a Lt. Colonel in the Russian military. He created the hacking malware used by dept. 26165, known as ""X-Agent."" Another hacker named in the indictment, Nikolay Kozachek, was a Lt. Captain in the Russian military. Artem Malyshev (also named in the indictment) was a Second Lieutenant in the Russian military. Aleksandr Osadchuk (also named in the indictment) is a Colonel in the Russian Military. He oversaw the creation and dissemination of anti-Clinton material online. 

 Article 19: Russian Military Officer Aleksey Potemkin, assigned to 74455, supervised the creation of fake social media accounts used (among other things) in the release of DNC documents.

Article 21: Over 300 individuals affiliated with the DNC were SUCCESSFULLY targeted. (Article 21 is lengthy, and includes a detailed, play-by-play account of how 26165 and 74455 achieved their aims. Spoiler alert: It's crazy).

Article 24, subsection B: The Russian's hacking of the DNC was so advanced that they were able to monitor individual computers in real time. Subsection C states that their malware sent actual screenshots of DNC computer activity to a server in Arizona that the Russians had access to. They were also able to capture keystrokes entered by DCCC employees.

Article 24, subsection D: They monitored individual DNC / DCCC employees for hours on end, and obtained information about DNC fundraising plans and even banking information (as well as other personal information).

Article 26 subsection A: By June 2016 the Russians had complete access to 33 DNC computers, totally and completely.

Article 27: The GRU gained access to information regarding DNC opposition research, field operation plans, and the Benghazi operation.

Article 28, subsection B: Aside from the server in Arizona, the GRU also stored data to a server in Illinois, to which they filtered large gigabytes of stolen information via a program they developed known as ""X-Tunnel.""

Article 32: The DNC became aware of Russian attempts to hack their servers and hired a security firm to identify the extent of the intrusions. The security firm (identified in the indictment only as ""company 1"") also put in place measures to halt GRU access to DNC computers, but, despite this, the GRU was so efficient that they continued to maintain access via ""X-Agent"" well through October of 2016.

Article 33: The GRU immediately became aware of ""company 1's"" (referring here to the security firm that the DNC hired) efforts, and took countermeasures in response. This included investigating / hacking ""company 1"" itself, and later, apparently as a retaliatory measure against the DNC, setting up a wesbsite that redirected from a DNC online political donations website, to another website set up by the GRU (in other words, the GRU took funds from DNC donors, using the pretext of a false DNC donations website).

Articles 35-36: The GRU set up another website, the sole purpose of which was to release stolen DNC documents. They created fake social media accounts that falsely attributed this website's creation to a group of ""American hacktivists."" It received over 1 million hits.

Article 37: The GRU has also released stolen documents dating back to 2015 (i.e., they've been up to this for quite a while).

Article 40: The notion of a ""lone Romanian hacker"" being responsible for the DNC leaks was a fiction deliberately created by the GRU and disseminated via fake social media accounts.

Article 42: Using a popular blogging site, the GRU set up a blog that used the most ""searched for"" keywords by conspiracy theorists, (e.g., ""Illuminati,"" ""Worldwide,"" ""Conspiracy,"" et. al.), -and used this website to further disseminate the ""lone Romanian hacker"" conspiracy theory. (Article 46 of the indictment further states that later entries on this blog site posted articles positing that the released, stolen documents had ""nothing to do with Russia."")

Article 43, Subsection A: An individual the indictment identifies only as ""a known member of congress"" contacted an online GRU dummy persona, (""Guccifer 2.0"") and requested stolen documents related to their political opponent, and the GRU / ""Guccifer"" responded by giving said member of congress access to the stolen data they were requesting.

Article 43, Subsection B: The GRU released stolen documents to what the indictment identifies as ""a lobbyist and online source of political news.""

Subsection C: ""Guccifer"" / The GRU sent stolen documents pertaining to the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement to a reporter (unidentified in the indictment), to which the reporter not only responded, but offered to write an article using said information.

Article 44: The GRU, posing as ""Guccifer 2.0"" wrote to a person who was in regular contact with SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. (The indictment includes direct quotes of their online conversation, and this is CLEARLY referring to Roger Stone).

Article 45, subsection B: The GRU, using an alias, contacted a U.S. reporter (unnamed in the indictment) and ultimately gave them access to stolen DNC data.

Articles 47-49: Here the indictment refers to an organization, identified only as ""Organization 1,"" [I'm thinking, Wikileaks] -which actually reached out to the GRU aliases seeking the stolen emails / data. ""Organization 1"" is directly quoted by the indictment as having communicated to ""Guccifer,"" that they should ""send [Organization 1] any new material [i.e., stolen data] here for us to review and it will have a much higher impact than what you are doing."" Organization 1 was given, and later released, said data, approximately 3 days before the Democratic National Convention. In total, between October and November of 2016, over 50,000 stolen documents were released.

Articles 50-79 : Lists the counts against the 11 Russian Military Personnel, which include charges of 1) Conspiracy to Commit Offenses Against The United States, 2) Aggravated Identity Theft, 3) Conspiracy to Launder Money [according to the indictment, over 95,000 USD$ was laundered], i.e. using cryptocurrency, that was then use to register domain names, set up websites, create server infrastructure, et. al.,3) The Use of Transferred Money To Commit Crimes Against The United States, 4) General Unlawful Conspiracy [It should be noted that many of these counts have sub-crimes attached to them, such as unlawful hacking, etc.].

So, there it is folks. This WAS A RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY, massive in scope, directly linked to the Trump campaign, the sole aim of which was to subvert Democracy. There is no way around it.

Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books. Scribes can make alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history.

I personally think that there is a huge market for Diablo 3 and a great opportunity for Blizz to merge the gameplay elements of two amazing games. 

Furthermore, you can speak of market saturation but the market is shrinking in part because very few new quality titles have been offered in the last couple of years in the MMO space. WoW is a cash cow right now for Blizzard, but a company that leans on it's cash cow is a company in decline. To stay in marketing speak, Blizzard needs a Star. 

The argument that it would split its base also doesn't hold up. WoW subscriptions have been declining for years, Blizzard shouldn't be worried about splitting their base, they should be worried about losing customers and clearly no WoW expansion can't truly fix the decline in the long term. 

My bold prediction is World of Diablo as MMO that will instantly rekindle the whole mmo genre and create a hype unlike we have ever seen, while the WoW series will slowly but surely go to free to play status (or perhaps free to play only for World of Diablo subscribers).

Yes, you are correct. Graduating Cumme Laude from Harvard Law is effectively impossible for somebody who isn't in the top 2% intelligence (I personally believe that accomplishment alone makes you at least likely top 75%-.25%... and that Shapiro being in the top 2% is inarguable)

Shapiro's intelligence is not a partisan issue. You can fully, rationally, and intelligently disagree with almost every single thing he has ever said and still admit that he is an intelligent individual. Graduating top of your class at Harvard means you had to get A's in almost all of your classes.

Its not that the salaries have to be equal, its just that any team over the cap cannot take in more than 125% + $100,000 (or there abouts) of the salary they send away. The Lakers, being under the cap, are thus not obligated to send out a certain amount of salary less than they take in. 

You also shouldn't sleep on the potential to stretch Deng's contract. $7m a year isn't that terrible of a cap hit, and if its for a Lebron+second-star team that doesn't have to give up any of their current players, they're not worried about marginally reduced cap space 4 and 5 years down the line.

It's quite short, but a bit complex. A simpler alternative I have seen in practice (when you're certain the list is finite and have pointer equality, such as Scheme's `eq?`) is to store the pointer to each `cons` cell you see and check if any are `eq?` to the list you're at. As the commentor above observed, this can be harder in Haskell, and this is primarily because it strives for referential transparency.

Well that's just not true. Nunes hasn't changed her cardio levels, she changed how she fought a specific opponent to last five rounds without giving the best counter striker in wMMA openings to capitalise on.

This is not the same as being able to explode in r1/r2 and still be able to fight in r5. She absolutely has not demonstrated the latter.

Pennington is clearly tougher than Tate. And besides Tate, Nunes has only run through Rousey, who I would give bet Rocky against at better than +150. Besides those two, her competition has either been not as good as Pennington, or she didn't get a stoppage, or she got stopped.

This is wMMA. Simply having toughness and cardio and being kind of awkward is sometimes enough. Yes, Nunes *can* finish her, obviously. Nunes is a real possibility to finish anyone in the division. But if she doesn't, Pennington is big enough and skilled enough and pushes enough of a pace that she could very easily get the win."	"I completely agree.

Don't include an assumption in the question, and never try to finish their thoughts for them.) 

Your priority is to listen, not even necessarily ""understand."" You don't have to contribute anything at all except an ear to be helpful. A person is helping themselves by simply airing and thinking through their thoughts, and most likely the only reason they need you is for the reassurance that they're not being silly or dumb, or because ""talking to an imaginary friend is what kids do."""

Maybe be a little more comfortable to shoot by using an actual stock and a vertical foregrip. 

Why should you go SBR versus AR Pistol:

1. The use of a brace on an AR pistol is contingent upon ATF not changing their mind on approval letters. Which they've already done, what, three times (it's OK, it's not OK, it's OK).
2. In the current session of Congress, the Democrats have already demonstrated that they understand this is a work-around and are seeking to close the ""loophole."" Look at HR 5103, [the Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5103/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225845+tax%22%5D%7D&amp;r=6). It didn't go anywhere, but, among other provisions, it ups the transfer and making tax to $500 and adds "" a semiautomatic pistol chambered for cartridges commonly considered rifle rounds, configured with receivers commonly associated with rifles and capable of accepting detachable magazines.' to the NFA definition of a firearm. Why worry? The Dems are getting smarter, increasing the tax on NFA transfers and making, and adding AR pistols to the NFA. A lot of neutrals in the gun debate wouldn't see anything particularly offensive about this and, if there's a shooting involving an AR pistol, there will be calls to regulate them. Then you'll be looking at paying $500 to register your AR pistol that you thought was outside the NFA.

""Glass"" is a huge field of materials science, and it turns out that you can make glass that is both more durable and less slippery than asphalt. A successful solar roadway is one that wouldn't need to be maintained as frequently as normal roadways, thus saving maintenance (and hopefully money).

Also, how often do you see roads covered with an opaque layer of dirt? Most roads are exposed to the sun most of the time. Even if they are dusty or grimy, the idea of solar roadways is that because they are such an economy of scale, reduced efficiency isn't that much of a detriment. Think of the articles on solar windows that pop up every now and then. It doesn't matter that they'd produce 10% the electricity of a dedicated solar panel, because if every equator-facing window of every skyscraper was producing *some* electricity, it'd be huge.

&gt; Plus roads are often shaded by vehicles and buildings. Plus to clean/replace them you have to close the road.

Some of the early research into solar roadways showed that even during bumper to bumper traffic, the amount of time a road surface is shielded from the sun is only like 50%. And that kind of traffic only occurs during a short part of the day.

&gt;Seriously can anybody explain why you wouldn't just put the panels somewhere better?

Solar roads bring up a bunch of interesting side benefits. In moderately cold areas, they can have heating elements which produce enough heat to prevent build up. Solar roads are also usually proposed as being covered in LEDs. When severe tile damage occurs (think pothole), they could highlight it. Traffic lines could be literally illuminated at night, improving safety. Since they're networked, the entire road system could be used to deliver road closure or detour messages. Since they're all interconnected and powered, they could also be designed to replace long runs of low-voltage overhead powerlines and telecommunication lines.

Problem is, they're a totally new concept that has state-of-the-art engineering challenges in materials science, electric microgrid research, and at the end of the day, cost. Nevertheless, I think the concept is sufficiently grounded in current technology to warrant research. Just don't expect them any time in the near future, and also don't be surprised if it's simply impossible to implement at a reasonable cost, ever."

"What's with the artwork? Really? You need to see more modern art, because that is *nothing*. I had the displeasure of visting MOMA PS1 in Queens a while ago.

He had other videos as well of him lighting his own back hair on fire and other charming activities. Compared to that, I would say a bit of non-explicit S&amp;M is nothing.

* Salesperson
* Broker

Salespersons need to work for a broker who ""holds their license"". Salespersons can not trade in real estate without a broker holding their license, and agreeing to oversee their activities. To become a broker, you need to pass three college classes, and pass a state exam.

To be a broker requires 2 years of experience and/or a 4-year degree, 8 college classes, and passing  state exam that fails about 70% of all test takers. It's a hard license to get as with it you can handle your own escrows, hold trust accounts, and employ other salespersons.

An ""agent"" is just a colloquial term for real estate agents that include both salespersons and brokers.

All REALTORS are Real Estate Agents (Salespersons/Brokers), but not all Real Estate Agents are REALTORS. To become a REALTOR, you must be licensed by your state, then you need to voluntarily join your local, state and federal board of REALTORS, and agree to follow the code of ethics. To be a REALTOR requires you to agree to run your business with rules that are far and wide more restrictive than what the state law would require.

Basically, you want to deal with a REALTOR. And, in California, you probably want to deal with a broker. AND, if you can find one, someone with the CRS designation would be a slam dunk :)

"I don't work in medicine, but I love research and learning, and this is a personal interest topic of mine. There are many studies and articles around to read for those who want to. Summary of it all is that we have more bacterial cells in us than actual human cells. They all seem to perform different roles in our health and can affect hormone levels, weight gain or loss, mental health, and cause or prevent diseases, allergies and food intolerances. When things get badly out of balance, they can cause the body to start attacking itself as in autoimmune disorders.

For example, I went to the doctor because of low energy, high stress, and blood tests showed I was in ""premature ovarian failure"" (ie early menopause). After a friend died in January, my digestion stopped working and I couldn't eat anything other than soup without agonising stomach pain and bloating. Doc suggested I get my microbiome screened at a lab in Australia (I live in NZ) called Bioscreen. It cost around A$500 for the works, then another $50 for my doc to get together with a local microbiologist to understand the results and come up with a treatment plan. My insurance is for surgery cover, so doesn't cover this.

For me, the results showed I have way too many streptococcus and too few E.coli. (Quoting from the microbiologist:) ""E.coli is an important intestinal micro-organism responsible for the synthesis of essential amino acids (eg. trytophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) vitamins (folic acid, vit K2) and coenzymes (CoQ10) important for cellular metabolism and reproduction. Determination into the levels of these essential amino acids in patients with persistent and chronic low levels of E.coli may be beneficial. Acute depletion of tyrosine and phenylalanine has shown to have selective effect on decision-making in depressive patients.""

This makes sense to me as my brain has felt a bit sub-par in recent years and I've been taking L-Tyrosine supplements, which help.

There are other bacteria that are also out of balance too, and I have blastocystis, which are microscopic parasites common in the developing world that I most likely picked up during travelling. My body's absorbing too much fat from the food I eat (I have put on fat around my middle that I never used to have), and is reabsorbing estrogen, putting all my sex hormones out of balance. My liver's having to deal with too much toxicity as a result, and my pancreas isn't working properly, the doc says.

My treatment plan involves a complex regime of certain antibiotics (to suppress the blastocystis - impossible to get rid of them completely, but at low levels they're not a problem for most people) and specific probiotics to bump up the types of bacteria I want, then more antibiotics and probiotics to rebalance the strep and e.coli. I have to practice mindfulness twice a day to calm my mind (there is a 2-way feedback loop between gut and brain), and completely cut out carbs including fruit for a month to starve the streptococcus (although should eat figs as they have a special type of sugar, fucose, that only e.coli can digest), then eat a low-ish carb diet with lots of vegetables. 

Doc says to allow 2-3 years to completely fix this. It's taken a lifetime to get this unwell, so it takes a long time to rectify. 

All the physical and mental stresses of life can affect your microbiome, the biggest being whether you're born the conventional way and pick up your mother's bacteria during the process, or by c-section. Whether you're breastfed or not; any surgery has a big impact as it's a major stress on the body and has been shown to change the shape of our bacteria; composition and variety of diet; antibiotics you've taken or you've eaten in food (ie used on animals); sleep patterns; medicines you've taken (even paracetamol); your exposure to bacteria from other people, animals, playing in the dirt as a child, etc.

It's an incredibly complex area of medicine and there's a lot of research going on at the moment. The composition of your microbiome can change the way your body responds to medicines, and I personally believe that understanding the microbiome will allow doctors to create personalised medicine and diet plans in the future.

MG/Lenny is such a stud RB1/2 duo, and MG has tons of upside given his insane usage, terrific pass attack in LA, and improved o-line. There are so many question marks with Ingram and Shady: 

- I think there are conflicting schools of thought on Ingram; I actually kind of like him, but there's risk. Basically, New Orleans fucking hates him, and he's on a contract year. Either a) they run him into the ground or b) they don't use him nearly as much as previously. I really don't know which it'll be, even though I would think they run him into the ground given the high powered offense and two-headed monster in the backfield. But I don't think there's solid evidence to suggest either option is inherently what the Saints will do. No matter what, Kamara is the back of the future, has more talent, and will likely outplay him in almost every way. 
- Shady is 30, has a trash pass attack, an awful o-line, and a bad defense that'll necessitate a lot of airing it out. He'll get insane volume, but he'll also have defenses focusing a ton on him since he's Buffalo's only real effective weapon. 

You have 3 top 13 RBs, some solid WRs in Mike, Jeffery, Edelman, Garcon, and Lockett (a nice mix of depth and upside), a good TE and an interesting bench piece in Dion Lewis (sorry but Marlon Mack is the garbageman lol). No need to make this trade since you don't need RB depth, and you'd be trading one of the safest RB options for some really risky guys who would almost certainly not be really needed on your team.

"You see this question pop up constantly in this forum - a common belief that 'only if my advertising/social media was better, I'd have more work'.

Photography as a business is mainly a 'people game' - the better you can connect with people, understand their needs and deliver them, the more they will spread the word and recommend you. 

If you don't focus on that, no amount of advertising or social media will help you when you are starting out.

So to grow your audience, go out and identify potential clients and understand what their needs are, then cold call/email them and propose how you can help them. You have to do the leg work and find/understand your clients - not hope that social media is a magical net that will gather all the clients to you with no effort."

I had the same reaction with him in *mother!*	"I can see you're struggling with this as a social gender issue rather than a pharmaceutical one. That's fair, women's BC has a pretty messed up history. The answer **you** want has very little to do with modern medical a drug regulations, and everything to do with regional/cultural norms. As a result, it comes with a whole bunch of assumptions - many of which are entirely reasonable but not necessarily relevant to the ostensible question.

So, the actual answer to your question is actually that this an entirely different drug in an entirely separate regulatory context. That it is treated strictly has very little to do with social trends. Further, to think thst nobody is working on women's birth control is to be mistaken; an area that potentially lucrative simply doesn't go ignored.

If you want me to address your social issues, that's a valid concern but not something I can answer. In my circles, nobody expects anything beyond carefulness and condom use - as we're well aware of nasty side effects. You say ""we""  -  I suspect that you're actually just expressing frustrations about your local sociocultural attitudes, not speaking for us all. I might be wrong about that, but I don't blame you if I'm right. It's frustrating.

All that said, I frankly don't feel all of that has an especially significant impact on drug development. The fact is, pharmaceuticals follow the money like everyone else. Having worked in the medical field, I would honestly say there's *more* of a trend to develop and market things for women right now, as this is seen as highly profitable.

So, this is probably not the answer you want, but the state of birth control is mostly to do with regulatory context over time and  the level of development in the drugs. I don't deny that cultural issues surrounding birth control exist (they absolutely do), I simply think they aren't the driving forces behind what you're observing. I hope all of that makes some sense, enjoy the essay."	Pretty much the literal word-for-word headline from the Stars beat writer after our game against them, too.	"&gt;Therapy advice was genuine.

&gt;Anyway, pushing your religion onto people is not cool. Save that zeal for offering out pamphlets on the street or something. Your ""thought experiment"" is also very bizarre and partly why I think you could benefit from therapy (honestly most of us can, no shame in it).

Where exactly did I push my religion? My mentioning the word ""sin""? Do you not agree that sin exists in the world? That horrible things happen? I don't see what's so controversial about that.

And I'm not 'pushing' but trying to get people to think. The fact that over 5000 people upvoted and approve of a man's mental weakness being encouraged for profit, is frankly disturbing.

&gt;Your ""thought experiment"" is also very bizarre

Sure, but it's called ""universalizing"" a choice in order to see its resulting moral reality. If we apply a moral decision to all of humanity, then we can see  how that moral decision truly affects on an individual level. If we ONLY look at the individual level, it's much harder to see how our actions affect someone. We have to take part in these mental games if we lose our empathy, as this women clearly has.

&gt;and partly why I think you could benefit from therapy (honestly most of us can, no shame in it).

Agreed, but not everyone has the ability to make that decision, let alone to spend money on it. I try to help when I can.

It could be assumed that the Bible, being a reflection of the time and customs of when it was written was only addressing a practice which was not considered immoral at the time.

Your other 2 examples are terrible, because yes you shouldn't buy the season pass of Spiderman even if the game sold well. You're going to get something, most likely sure, but you don't know what.

You're just buying a promise for something you don't even know if you'll want when it's actually for sale, so you can save money that you could have saved by waiting until the last DLC is out and buying the others on sale anyway, and you don't even know WHEN you're getting it.

And you generally shouldn't preorder games unless it's close to release and you've seen the game run well already(for example streamers getting early access, rather than PR-released trailers).

But if the game doesn't release, Steam will refund you, not the developer. Pretty sure Valve doesn't pay developers until their product is actually available, until then, they hold all the money, so refunding isn't a concern for them.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Urban Meyer. The playbook is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical offense most of the plays will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Meyer's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his play-calling - his football philosophy draws heavily from spread offense literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realise that they're not just effective- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Urban Meyer truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Meyer's existential play ""Zone-read option,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Erickson's American epic Miami offense. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Urban Meyer's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Urban Meyer tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

"I occasionally get solitary cockroaches in my house during the warmer months, it's kind of unavoidable in my part of the country. You should know, I hate cockroaches more than the average bear because of the time one crawled on my arm while I was sleeping, but I'm mostly able to tolerate them. I kill the more adventurous ones, so the only ones left are the shy ones. I don't see them, they don't get murdered. Everyone's happy.

Mostly unrelated (trust me, roaches will get in no matter what), I hadn't cleaned my house in a few months. Things were mostly pretty neat, but I hadn't swept or cleaned the baseboards or anything for a long time. I finally got off my ass to clean, and did it top to bottom.

Only problem is, now that everything is clean, I cleared out most of the roaches' hiding spots, and now they have to come out and search farther to find food and shelter, so all of a sudden they're appearing in places they didn't before, and venturing out farther and more ambitiously. I've seen 2 or 3 where previously I saw none. One climbed on my chair right behind my head (to which I responded with a manly ""Jesus...fuck you!"") It feels annoying that cleaning my house would result in more roach sightings, not less!

As a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. 

You will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.

Fitting this segment is happening in front of lockers. 	I think the problem is that to a player, that signing bonus is as much a reward for what they have done as it is a reward for what they will do.

Calvin Johnson had earned that money based on previous performance and the Lions going after it looked petty. The only real answer for this is that the NFLPA has to be stronger.

While child abuse and pedophile rings are indeed nothing new, a trend of asian grooming gangs being uncovered across the country certainly is. Whether you have a prior prejudice or not, it would be foolish to not ask questions or at least be curious of both the scale and connection of these gangs, and why so many were operating around the same time.        
       
There's also, undeniably the aspect of that the single trend with most of these gangs is their predominantly south asian ancestry, and that does have to be examined because it is very unique. After all, there aren't a string of afro-Caribbean grooming gangs, or east-asian. So that's bound to be a point of fixation, prior prejudice or not. Why are these gangs predominantly south asian? Why are the victims predominantly white? Is it coincidence? Is it cultural? Is it linked to a criminal network?

But on the other, websites shouldn't serve intrusive ads, shouldn't creepily track user behaviour and should never ever serve malware ads. 

A prime example how to do everything wrong is the livestreaming site twitch.tv. When you open a new livestream, you immediately face a long, unskippable pre-roll ad, which is obviously an idiotic idea on a live streaming platform. And I have personally got my browser auto-redirected to a fishing site from a malware ad on twitch (back when I whitelisted twitch). It isn't whitelisted anymore. "	PTP wireless FTW.

"&gt;Why do you think this is true?

Qualcomm’s intellectual property has been contributed—by Qualcomm—to various standards bodies in order to make sure that Qualcomm technology is part of the specification that *all* cellular companies will have to use when building out new cellular networks. 

&gt;    Who “requires” Qualcomm to do this?

The same standards bodies that Qualcomm has contributed their technology to. Essentially, they say “hey Qualcomm, if you want us to include your technology as part of this cellular standard, then you need to make sure that anybody who wants to create cellular equipment can license your patents under terms that are fair, reasonable, and non discriminatory.”

Apple cannot build a cell phone without licensing Qualcomm’s technology *because Qualcomm’s technology is part of the cellular phone standard (i.e. specification).* And, since nobody could build a standards-compliant phone without Qualcomm technology, the applicable standards bodies usually require contributors such as Qualcomm to license said technology at [fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing).

"That's the sad part, the audience (probably the better description) accepted it like it was gospel (pun 100% intended).

Before he said that he said ""there's something that requires a bit of reading to know, but don't worry, I did it so you don't have to. I studied it this week while you were all doing real jobs.""

There were anatomically modern humans on Earth for a long time, and they left very few artifacts of tools, pottery, burials, art, etc. On an evolutionary timescale, the transition from this state to one where humans were burying their dead, making tools, large campsites, and pottery, was very abrupt. The state transition was very quick, and there is little anatomical difference between the populations \(before Smart vs after Smart\). This suggests that the genetic changes were very minor, and thus only small adjustments in brain architectures were needed to go from Not\-Smart humans and Smart humans."	"&gt; CCA spoiler!

""Why good men need to reclaim masculinity from the toxic cliche of power and aggression""

right beside

""All hail the rise of cat men, an antidote to toxic masculinity""

A lot of people seem to forget that we are but one society in a world of many, including a couple that are going to be economic behemoths in the near future. One of them is already starting to flex its muscle and believes that its dominance is a matter of manifest destiny. Chinese grandeur makes American exceptionalism seem quaint.

Yet here we are at home feminizing our men and ensuring they will be incapable of confronting and competing in a shrinking world where nothing is guaranteed and what we have needs to be fought for with far more than a crafty social media campaign.

""Toxic"" masculinity will soon embrace every aspect of masculinity that women do not possess or that men have in greater abundance. This will not do for feminists, as it's a competitive advantage against them. ""Equality"" demands that we be further gagged, bound and publicly flogged. This is where women do excel - emotional manipulation. And with every mangina they add to their ranks there's one more vote for them and one less for us.

Their opinions were based on the fact that Porto is a Primeira Liga team and Liverpool is a Premiere League one. It is true that those people don't know enough about Porto. If Porto played like they usually do, it wouldn't have been one-sided. 

After Liverpool beat City, it was only reasonable that people were very confident in saying that they would also beat Swansea. Look what happened. That doesn't mean those people's opinions were wrong."	"

"The value of a currency is determined by how much of it is available on the world market relative to other currencies and relative to the amount of stuff being sold priced in that currency. If you increase the amount of currency relative those things, you decrease the value, and vice versa.

It's a *lot* easier for a government to change the amount of currency available relative to other countries' currency than it is to change the amount of stuff being sold, so that's how currency manipulation usually works. Say you want to decrease the value of the US dollar relative to the Euro, so you simply buy up a bunch of Euros (or assets that are equivalent to Euros, like bonds) using US dollars. Get a few billion more dollars on the world market and a few billion fewer Euros, and you'll make the US dollar worth fewer Euros. Want the US dollar to be stronger? Start selling those Euros for dollars.

This is one of the reasons China has so many US government bonds: Bonds are more or less equivalent to money, so by buying US bonds with Chinese Yuan, they kept the value of the Yuan down relative to the US dollar.

As to how it affects you: A weaker currency makes it easier to export but more expensive to import. If you want to improve your export sectors, then, a weaker currency can help. But that is balanced out by harming your import sectors. There's always a tradeoff."	That sharp Astora Greatsword, though..

"I find it easier to get through a book that I don't like much, by changing my perception from reading for fun, to reading critically.

Sometimes it's nice to actually criticise a bad book - and have some intelligible reason to not have liked it.

That said, I only do this with books that are actually well written, or an interesting plot, or something. If it's literally garbage then I wouldn't bother.

As I mentioned in another comment, throwing anything into the cage could theoretically be hazardous to the safety of the fighters. The referees should never let it get to the point where the corner has to throw in the towel.

In practice, though, it's still pretty well understood what it means. I'm confident that any referee would respect the wishes of the corner when they do throw the towel, but that doesn't change the fact that it is technically a foul."	"12 team PPR, keep 2.

Defining ""Heaven"" and ""Hell"" isn't enough when you when you don't acknowledge what it means for someone to be in Heaven or Hell in the first place. It isn't ""pedantry"" to point out that you don't sufficiently understand the bases of the question you wish to ask. A test question based on faulty premises isn't a good test question, and the student would be justified in pointing that out. You keep saying over and over that it's a simple question, but it's not-- it's a *bad* question because it hardly makes sense given the reality of the topics that you're talking about. In order to engage in this thought experiment about whether you'd sacrifice your salvation for someone else's if given the chance, I also have to engage in the thought experiment that proposes that salvation isn't an intrinsic experience of your union with God-- a thought experiment that's akin to asking the question of what it'd be like to live in a universe where green was purple.

&gt;You haven't been able to account for your belief that goodness is a thing, which was my original point. In a world without God trying to make these things intelligible is futile.

If goodness is a moral judgement that we place on actions, then I don't know what else is needed to account for that.

It could be that in a world without God it is futile to try to make these things intelligible, or it could be that it is futile to try to make these things intelligible to someone who refuses to see it so if no god is involved. I am sincerely trying to help you understand my perspective, and I thank you for your help in making me articulate it and lay it all out. Do you think it is possible that you can see something as intelligible without agreeing with it? I can definitely understand how someone sees their position with God as intelligible, even if I don't agree with it.

&gt;You haven't been able to show that God is not a necessary precondition for the intelligibility of this subject, so you have not answered a burden of rejoinder.

Never heard of the burden of rejoinder before, but from what I recall this discussion was about establishing the intelligibility of a moral system without God, not in demonstrating that God is not a necessary precondition for the intelligibility of morality.

&gt;I am arguing that you need to presuppose the Christian God before you can make human experience intelligible.

And I was trying to show my perspective that you don't need any gods to make a grounded moral system. Perhaps this is part of why we've been at odds? The only debate I'm trying to 'win' here is to show that my perspective is not incoherent.

&gt;It is by God that we see and understand all things my friend, but you have to be willing to think in two paradigms rather than just your own. 

I am, but any argument that can show that all values come from God given God is useless to me, since I am not convinced that any gods exist. I can understand your perspective and see how it is internally coherent, even if I disagree with it.

&gt;I have tried to extend that courtesy to you I simply don't think your position is a rational one, and I don't mean that in a hostile way its just my understanding of your position.

And that is totally fair, I don't see it as a hostile way of saying it. I'm just still having trouble understanding where exactly we disagree.

Kek"	"I'm glad you brought this up. Time to vent a bit.

There are so many stories about agents \-\- dozens or hundreds \-\- passing on what would become wildly successful books that I'm starting to lose respect for agents. Am I the only one who feels that way? It's so ridiculous that landing an agent \(or not\) is no indication of a story's worth, or the writing.

The list is way too long: J.K. Rowling, Patrick Rothfuss and the King Killer Chronicle, John Kennedy Toole and the Confederacy of Dunces, etc., etc., etc. Rothfuss couldn't get an agent. He packaged \(no doubt in frustration\) one of his chapters as a short story and submitted to a short story contest, which he won. Only then could an agent be found who was willing to trouble himself with his books.

Toole killed himself in frustration, believing his book was good, and he couldn't get anybody to read it. According to the traditional lore, his mother convinced an agent to read the manuscript only after explaining that her son killed himself because nobody would give it a try. This is, pardon me if I'm stepping on toes, fucking pathetic.

It's unfortunate that these folks \-\- agents \-\- are the gateway to traditional publishers. They're making self\-publishing look better and better all the time.

Okay, I've said my piece. I'd love to hear a real agent weigh in with an explanation for this sorry state of affairs. I will not accept the old line about ""we get a lot of submissions"". We're in the electronic age, so how hard could it be to ask for full manuscripts from everybody and then select 10\-15 paragraphs randomly from inside to see if the writer can put together a compelling sentence, and then decide whether or not to try the entire thing, start to finish? What am I missing? Maybe I'm wrong. One thing is clear: the current system is not working. Writers and readers are getting screwed."

"Ultimately, I don't think it's up to a developer to be one the executing a 400 person studio. The things you touched on deadlines, stakeholders, pr, and etc. are more to do the with the company structure than the game designers.

More fair comparison would be producer, script writing, anything that isn't the giant responsibility and cluster-fuck that is being a movie director lol.

It feels real. 

There's a tangible, holdable, end product. It is something that exists and has existed. And while it is eminently possible to adjust a negative or print to remove certain unwanted or unpopular elements (Mr. Trotsky), it takes some effort to do. A level of skill beyond being a photoshop pilot.

It's very easy to create artificial things - moments that never were - in digital media. It's already possible to use AI technology to basically replace faces and bodies in movies with whatever actors or people you want. It won't be long before entire scenes and realities can be artifically fabricated with the click on an AI button. 

I feel at times that a lot of the thoughts we think, or the feelings we have aren't really our own anymore. They're implants and seeds, created from artificial sources with ulterior agendas. We're being used by our own minds in a way that is unprecedented in history. It's frigtening in a lot of ways. Depressing in others. 

I'm not too naive to think that this hasn't always happened, of course. Just by reframing a shot, and changing the context of the surroundings, you do much the same thing. But the scope and nature of it has exceeded anything imagineable. Even these are at least based on some level in an objective reality. True reality dies when every image can be faked in a targetted way with some dropdowns and some reference material and a box of tricks. 

With a negative, or a slide, you have some physical imprint of a thing that happened. A moment in reality, or a feeling in that moment. This is physical proof that something actually existed. A thing happened. That feeling you have, or that thing you remembered - it was really there. 

The things that really matter to me - like major holidays, or events or the like - they're done as much as possible on film.

That's a personal reason. I wonder if other people don't feel the same way.

I think so long as there's weird hipstery ideas like that out there, there'll be a market for film on some level. What we're seeing now is a sort of regearing of the massive production behemoths to meet that small 'pilot plant' level of demand.

Perhaps the first part of that sentence explains the second.

&gt;    In what way could Apple accept a deal, accept parts, then decide the deal was bad and not pay a bill.

Exactly the way you just explained it!

It’s a bit more nuanced than that, though. Apple doesn’t have a choice to make a deal—they are *compelled* to make a deal with Qualcomm in order to make a standards-compliant cell phone (i.e. one that will work on public cellulsr networks). They have no choice.

Qualcomm, in return, is *required* to license their technology using terms that are fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory. That’s the “price” they are required to pay to have their technology become part of the standard that everybody will use.

&gt;If Apple already owes money to Qualcomm, and Qualcomm did not attend to change the deal after closing it, I don’t understand in what way Apple is not responsible to pay.

Apple will end up paying *something*. However, they have elected not to pay anything at all at the moment because they don’t feel the terms that they are *compelled* to agree to are “fair and reasonable.” And they seem to be willing to place a fairly large bet that a jury will agree with them.

What ""Working class hero"" Stephen ""Tommy Robinson"" Yaxley-Lennon did then was to basically break those rules. Then he was told off about it - given a second chance, and told not to do it again or he'd be given jail time.

So obviously, he then went and did it again.

I mean, let's say a guy is driving his car, down a winter, icy, windy, isolated road. 

His girlfriend is the passenger. (They just met a week ago... so she's certainly not his ""spouse"" in any way yet.)

They have an argument. 

He stops the car. Tells her to get out. Makes sure she ""exits safely"" as you say... 

And then he leaves her there, drives away, and she dies. 

And he says to the police, ""But detective: I made sure she exited the vehicle safely!"" 

Good luck with that holding up in court! 

The same extends to the Uber driver I feel. In the end the Uber driver is a captain of his/her ship (car), and has a responsibility for the safety of the passengers. 

So even if Uber rules say he/she could leave someone stranded in a blizzard... I don't think any District Attorney is going to let something like that stand, if the passenger is killed or injured by being stranded by an Uber driver.

Soooooo...."	"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."	"I can't tell if you're disagreeing with the person you're responding to. It's definitely more enabling by responding to his insults.

To claim that something is **true** requires evidence. Apparently Sheldon agrees with me. He admits that it *is* possible that there is going to be a million dollars on his bed.

"He created Hobgoblin and wrote most of his stories, and wrote a genuine classic in ""The Boy Who Collected Spider-Man""."	Great example. I was not interested in that movie until I saw the trailer.

Market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency. Many forms of market manipulation are prohibited in most countries, in particular, it is prohibited in the United States under Section 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in the European Union under Article 12 of the Market Abuse Regulation, in Australia under Section 1041A of the Corporations Act 2001, and in Israel under Section 54(a) of the securities act of 1968. The Act defines market manipulation as transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradeable security. Market manipulation is also prohibited for wholesale electricity markets under Section 222 of the Federal Power Act and wholesale natural gas markets under Section 4A of the Natural Gas Act.

"Interesting followup: if that 40:1 ratio is correct, it means that for wizards to think about removing the RL, the proportion of the playerbase in favor of removing the RL would have to be *insanely* overwhelming.

That ratio would mean that even 97% isn't enough (because with a 40x multiplier, 3% against is 120%), and given that such a process would be subject to statistical noise, even 98% vs 2% (80%) is not much better than a tied vote. The RL is not popular but it is probably still more than 2% popular - you can't get 99% of magic players to agree on ANYTHING, much less something that directly affects their pocketbooks to the tune of thousands of dollars. 

And thus the status quo remains."	We don't know until it pops right? But in all seriousness, most economists say we are not in a housing bubble, which would be prices supported by unsustainable demand. Last decade, demand was supercharged by easy money lending that allowed almost everyone to get a loan, regardless of whether they could afford to pay it back. Prices surged as a result, until those people could no longer pay. Prices then crashed. This time around economists say the boom is more sustainable. Lending regulations are far tighter, the economy is strong and most people can afford the homes they are buying, even if they are stretching somewhat. That's not to say prices won't come down during a recession, or even that there couldn't be a decline absent a recession. The housing market is showing signs of slowing now as mortgage rates rise and one expert I quoted in the story below does think you could see some declines around the corner.

"	"It may not be the majority, but there are a lot. Going off the top of my head, we've got the Jedi temple being over the ruins of a Sith temple, the Rebel base on Yavin IV being a Jedi temple, I think the Dagobah cave had some weird history behind it, and there was some weird force stuff going on with Jakku that Palatine was personally interested in.

There's not really any reason for all of that, and I feel it does more harm than good. For one thing, it takes away from the characters and their accomplishments; would Luke have been able to destroy the death star if he wasn't near an ancient Jedi temple? Would Anakin and Obi-Wan's battle have gone different if it was on neutral territory?

Second, it makes the unfeeling a lot smaller. Yoda was on dagobah because it was such an obscure planet that nobody would have any reason to go to, but apparently that tree had some significance. What's to stop someone from just stumbling across him while they go to check out the tree? It's a major theme for the story that Jakku has nothing of value to offer, but it also has some kind of major history that palpatine had been researching.

None of these things come up in the movies, they're just tacked on after the fact. They don't add much if any significance to the story, and take away more than they give. "	Yes.

It has moments of outrageous whimsy. But it’s a very dark film, with stylistically frightening and creepy scenes used a ton, it’s often gritty, thematically heavy, and is quite violent and startling, one scene involving a man being murdered via blunt force trauma, and then a zoom in on his mutilated, twisted body and face. It’s then revealed a CHILD did this out of vengeance for calling him a freak.

&gt;Add in child abuse, grooming, and fascism, with sight of injury, creepy death penalties, and yes, intense genre violence and city-destruction, it’s clearly a PG-13 movie that only gets darker as the franchise wears on...likely ending with the fall of the third reich and the end of the holocaust.

Tell me how a book like Goodnight Mr Tom can be called a kids book, and the film shown to children in schools if the presence of such themes makes a story inherently adult? Dark themes, death, harsh consequences, allusions to greater horrors, have all been part of children's literature for centuries. I mean at least where i'm from kids learn to read using books based on brutal old Germanic fairytales about cannibalism, involuntary servitude, child abduction etc... scratch the surface of 'outrageous whimsy' and its not unusual to find darkness in stories that kids love.

What's ACTUALLY true here is that those games would still exist regardless because if it will bring in money, someone will fund it to get their return back.

I'm not sure if what you're saying is true either. Let's start from a point I'm sure we can all agree on:

Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo want to make money. So do EA, Ubisoft, Sega, and other third parties.

The console makers get money from the fees they take from publishers releasing games on their consoles, PSN purchases, the accessories they sell (e.g. controllers), selling consoles (later in the console lifestyle), and from the revenue that their own games generate.

The third parties get money from the revenue that the games they develop/publish generate, including microtransactions and season passes. This also includes revenue from Origin/UPlay sales since those games are developed/published by EA/Ubisoft anyway.

There's a major difference in the way these companies get money. The third parties get most of their revenue from games, but the revenue that Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo receive is much more varied. 

Therefore, games released by a third party must be profitable because otherwise the third party would bankrupt itself. There can be exceptions - perhaps by releasing an unprofitable game that becomes GOAT, the company's reputation skyrockets and that unprofitable game ends up helping in the long run - but generally speaking the third parties' games must be profitable.

Obviously, Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo also want their games to be profitable. However, because their sources of revenue are more varied, they *can* afford to take more risks, resulting in the first party developers receiving more creative freedom and larger budgets. Does this actually happen? I would say yes. For example, Shenmue was so expensive to develop that every Dreamcast owner would have to buy the game twice in order for the game to turn a profit. As you mentioned already, many PlayStation games like Quantic Dream's titles, Team Ico's titles, and Media Molecule's titles are pretty niche.

Therefore, I think those first party exclusives might exist, but in a different shape or form because of the limitations that developers could possibly face because they're a third party studio."

And a good thing to take in mind is to conduct social accounts that a company can easily link you to with professionalism.

&gt;I acted nice to her but I didn’t really like her. Is that backstabbing? 

Of course not. That's being excessively polite and feeling an onus to support her, something you are still prone to and that she has taken advantage of the entire time she has known you. Backstabbing is what she does, actively undermining your standing with peers and strangers for her own gain.

Stop trying to pass things off as 'not your fault'. That's not relevant here, and it really showcases your lack of empathy. 

It doesn't matter that you're just reinforcing their dad's rules, nor does it matter how reasonable those rules are. You're acting like an authoritarian parent for older teenagers that you barely have a relationship with. You're also close to their age and just moved in a few months ago. It's not about whether or not a 17-year-old should be able to follow those rules. Yes, she's perfectly capable of following the rules. She's just not capable of respecting your authority, which is totally reasonable under the circumstances. If your fiance honestly thinks that it's appropriate to put you in that role right away, he is pretty out-of-touch with reality. Basically, I don't care whose decision it was for you to play that role, because it was a terrible decision. 

Why did you put ""made them get rid of the dog"" in quotation marks like it was a crazy accusation? You *did* make them get rid of the dog. And every time someone mentions this, you explain that it wasn't your decision, that the girls still get to see their dog...or you reinforce how bad your trauma was. The point is, to teenage girls going through a difficult situation, *that shit doesn't matter*. The fact that you really, *really* struggle to live with dogs (as opposed to just being annoyed by them or something) does nothing to reduce the pain of losing their dog. You could have the best reasons on earth and it wouldn't change the fact that they lost their dog. It's nice that they can still see it sometimes, but having a dog at home is not the same as having occasional visitation rights for a dog. Pets also really help people with emotional support, which those girls probably needed during a time of transition like this. And regardless of who made the final decision, it was made as a direct result of you. You showed up in the house and the dog left. Of course they blame you.

Here's the thing: you're focusing on why nothing is your fault...when a mature adult would acknowledge how hard this must be on the girls. Their dad is dating someone the same age as his oldest daughter. A new person moved into their house very suddenly and is trying to parent them in a very authoritarian, infantilizing way. Plus, they had to give up their dog. This is a huge amount of transition for teenagers, who often struggle with self-regulation and who don't have much control over their lives. The fact that you didn't mean to negatively affect them doesn't make it any easier on them, and you need to own that. 

Your presence has created a lot of instability in their lives, but you expect them to magically be ok with that simply because you weren't trying to be an asshole? You're not mature enough to be the adult of the house. The girls can see that and they're not wrong.

"It certainly wasn't meant to be a trap, only to submit that there is a clear difference between your example of explaining something to your children as a comparable gulf between God and us - *you* are the shortcoming in not being able to teach/communicate effectively at your child's level.

But God, who is omniscient and omnipotent, has no limitation - were there something he wanted us to understand, there is literally (literally, literally) nothing in his way... In fact, any shortcomings we would have in understanding something he could simply correct for us. The clear answer from a theological perspective to counter this is just to say that we are not meant to understand, that this is merely a part of the process of coming to terms with our faith in his plan and his unlimited wisdom. I don't buy that, being secular, but it's a reasonable answer from that perspective.

Also, the square circle is a bad example, too... These are clearly definable, tangible concepts whose form is rooted in strict guideline - any change, and it ceases to become what it originally was. We're not talking about transmutation of concepts that must simultaneously be what they once were and another thing all at once, this is asking to explain a single concept.

I'm from the UK, and over here if you're a student you can get a free cheeseburger with the purchase of a meal at McDonalds. I redeemed mine but was full after eating, so I put the wrapped burger in my bag in case I wanted to reheat it later (this is relevant).

A few hours later I was walking down the street and a dishevelled-looking woman in a wheelchair came over to me. She started complimenting my hair and outfit.
Then out of nowhere she went on a ten minute sob story about how her boyfriend beat her, she was now homeless and her kids had been taken off her (I just nodded politely and asked if she had called the police, but she kept going and I was too awkward to leave). Then she asked did I have any money, because she ""hadn't eaten in five days"".

I remembered my student cheeseburger, and said ""sorry, I don't have any cash on me, but I can give you this?"" and got it out of my bag and passed it over.
She took it, then immediately went from being full of compliments and crying to looking really agitated, and said, ""this is freezing. I don't want this, this burger is cold, what the fuck. Are you sure you don't have any money on you? I need money, not a burger""

I said no and that I had to go now, and after that practically sprinted away feeling super awkward.
I relayed this story to my friend later on, who said I should have just given her some money for a fresh burger because they're only £1, but I didn't have any cash on me and it would have required going to an ATM and taking out at least £5, and she probably would have just asked for that.

India is far to heterogeneous to be ever really categorized the way the US or the UK can be, of China and the other Asian countries. Most of the country is still well behind in terms of education, awareness and plain common sense in the modern ideas of life and living, but not all of the country. The caste system, just like religion, has been twisted and manipulated into a political and social engineering tool to divide and conquer various sections of the multitudes of peoples that form the country. This kind of thing is rampant in North India specifically because the political and religious organizations that hold sway over the woefully undereducated people has left them still very ignorant and bigoted against anything that doesn't align with their own notions. That's why things like this happen. The caste system is used as a vote bank, and a way to manipulate and control the people, and since the ascension of the draconean BJP government, it's pretty much spiked to a staggering level thanks to the divisive rhetoric of the party and its associates. And caste is only a small part.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ichorum has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Many Eyes.***  The ichorum has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and on saving throws against being blinded and stunned. The ichorum can't be surprised.

***Ichor Spout (Recharge 4–6).*** At the start of the ichorum's turn, it magically conjures a liquid which wells within the folds of its skin before spewing forth in a revolting convulsion. The liquid conjured is determined randomly from the list below or chosen by the DM. Every creature and surface in a 10-foot cube originating from the ichorum is coated with the liquid, the effects of which are described in the list below. A coating or pool of liquid on a surface evaporates or dries after 10 minutes, ending the effect.

1. *Scalding Water.* A steaming spout of scalding water is sprayed forth. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Open flames in the area such as torches or campfires are extinguished, and other liquids from this trait in the area are rinsed away, except for tar.
2. *Acid.* Bubbling acid sprays forth, coating the area. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5 (2d4) acid damage, and 2 (1d4) acid damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute, or until it is rinsed away, or until a creature wipes away the liquid with an action.
3. *Ichor.* Each creature in the area is sprayed with a vile, foul-smelling, viscous brown liquid. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat its save at the start of each of its turns, ending the poison on a success.
4. *Tar.* Thick, black tar coats the area, creating an area of difficult terrain. Each creature in the area is coated in tar, and must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved until the start of its next turn. The tar remains for 1 minute, when it dries and crumbles away, or after being dissolved by acid, or after being rinsed away with oil (water can't rinse away the tar).
5. *Oil.* Thin, slippery oil is sprayed all over the area, making it slick and leaving acrid fumes. Surfaces in the area are treated as if targeted by the *grease* spell, and any objects or creatures coated in oil that are exposed to open flames take 7 (2d6) fire damage, and are ignited. An ignited creature or object takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until the fire is put out. An ignited creature can put out the flames by either submerging in water, or by dropping prone and using an action to roll back and forth.
6. *Blood.* A spout of blood belches forth from the ichorum. A creature coated in blood must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become panicked for 1 minute, or until the blood is rinsed off. A panicked creature is frightened of the ichorum, and can repeat its save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on a save against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.  
&amp;nbsp; A panicked creature must spend its movement on each of its turns moving toward the nearest open body of water if one is in sight and within 300 feet, or away from the ichorum otherwise. The only actions a panicked creature can take is to empty a carried vessel of water on itself to rinse away the blood if no body of water is in sight within 300 feet, or to Dash, Disengage if necessary, or attempt to end an effect that is preventing it from moving.

####Actions
___

***Multiattack.*** The ichorum makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Roll a d4. On result of 4, the target is also coated in a liquid determined randomly, or chosen by the DM, from the ichorum's Ichor Spout trait.

"Right, and good on you. The hate isn't about the scaling or level in and of itself, it's the fact that Blizz removed almost every alternative option for people who just wanted to play endgame on an alt except for level boosts.

Hell I was personally excited for level scaling as it would make the dungeon run/spam/grind more diverse/enjoyable, or so I thought before I knew about the xp/health boost.

They knew RaF was mostly used to level alts, so they nerfed it from 200% to 50%. They massively lowered drop rates of xp potions. They nerfed heirloom stats, buffed mob health, and buffed xp/level by up to 60% in some levels, starting at level 40.

The content did not become harder or change in anyway except time investment, and the mob health boost killed dungeon spamming, as previously 15 min dungeon runs now take 45 min, but have the same xp reward for all that effort. 

Their main argument for making leveling longer was so people, new players especially(?), experienced ""key storylines"" and had a better experience coming into the game..

Except much of what they touched affects veteran players, not new ones.

But, you know, they didn't change the level boosts existence or cost. That's still there, including the free boost, despite allowing the 'new player' to skip 'key storylines'.

Those who are pro patch and who are shutting down anyone who complain are doing so based on the 'git gud' toxic hardcore mindset. They also use the emotional argument of ""I enjoyed it, therefore your opinion is subjective and not an objective complaint of gameplay, as I'm intelligent and know what's bad/I can handle it therefore so can you, therefore stfu.""

"Generally that's how you level, yes. You explore a zone to 100%, do all events you come along, collect all crafting materials and unlock more of your class, all the while playing through your personal story.

You can do the story mode of dungeons you can access at your level, and once a day they reward the larger chunk of a level, however Dungeons are pretty dead these days. "	The struggles...	"Ditto. Got Dawn a few months ago.

The gif that keeps on giving.	Justice is very different from revenge.

The idea is that while they will lose money on most people switching, they'll make a lot of money on a few others. People tend to go to their bank first if they want to borrow money. One loan and they get that money back.

Another thing to note is that FirstDirect, which was the first bank that came to mine when I read your post, isn't free. They charge you £10 per month if you don't have a certain amount of money in your account, or you don't have a loan with them. So they get that money back eventually, either through the fee or through using the money in your account to loan out to other customers.

Finally, they're banking (no pun intended) on the fact you won't change banks when the year is up. The reality is that most people are lazy, so it's a reasonable assumption to make.

But, the future is bright! We have a young up-and-coming sniper of a goal scorer in 21-year old [Brock Boeser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvBxR28WHco)

Top prospect Elias Pettersson (who was only 19 years old) dominated the Swedish Hockey League this past season. And the SHL isn't just some development league for young players. It's a fully professional league featuring grown men. And Pettersson blew away the competition. From breaking [42 year old scoring records](http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/elias-pettersson-scoring-record-sweden-2018-canucks) to winning [Rookie of the Year](https://www.vancourier.com/pass-it-to-bulis/elias-pettersson-named-shl-rookie-of-the-year-best-forward-and-mvp-1.23286049) to being named [Playoff MVP](http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/elias-pettersson-shl-mvp-playoffs-record-2018-canucks) as he lead the Vaxjo Lakers to a crushing sweep of opposing Skelleftea.

"As I've told you in a different thread, they could move the alternative modes to a separate queue instead of being embedded in Casual, and simply opt to make that a ""random crits queue"". At that point, Casual would consist of only ""core gamemodes"" and would not have random crits. Additionally, CTF should be moved to the new queue as opposed to being in Casual.

This solves the issue of endless queue times which other, similar suggestions have. Because unlike a ""Random Crits tickbox"", we're not actually copying and pasting map pools between different modes, but are instead dividing the map pool between two queues. The number of queue variables remains exactly the same, meaning no significant change in queue time.

It'd be a good compromise. Those that like random crits are often the people who also like wacky, non-serious, non-standard maps like Hightower, and it's not really necessary to remove random crits from those maps anyway.

Partly that's because we're dealing with DNA, which we think of as our essence, and partly because the designs of these web sites are so snappy. It looks like you're getting a blood pressure or temperature reading. But there's a lot of ambiguity to these tests. If you go to different companies for your ancestry, you may get different percentages. That's not because they're fundamentally wrong, but because they're using different samples of people and different population-genetic models to estimate your ancestry. Likewise, if you find out from a company that you don't have a cancer-causing BRCA1 cancer mutation, it's still possible that you have one that the company doesn't yet test for.

"The developer documentation for OS X has been deteriorating too. Increasingly you have to rely on tribal knowledge and whatever you can puzzle out of WWDC slide decks rather than the actual docs.

Case in point: the CoreAudio docs were never amazing, but they were adequate if not always up to date. I'm having a really tough time figuring out some fundamental things about AVAudioEngine. Which is a shame, because it is a really great framework if you can get it to do what you want it to do. (Anyone realize there's now a supported minimum phase resampling algorithm?

&gt;The philosophical definition of necessary isn't the first definition in the dictionary. Necessary means the negation cannot be true in any world. It may be necessary, in the colloquial sense, for me to do A if God foresees it because to do otherwise would prove God wrong, but it's not necessary in the philosophical sense because in another world God could foresee me doing B.

I would disagree, the Oxford dictionary has,

&gt;&gt;1. Needed to be done, achieved, or present; essential.

&gt;&gt;2. Determined, existing, or happening by natural laws or predestination; inevitable

Both the first and second definitions do not allow for the negation to be true. The first in the ""colloquial"" sense, the second in the formal.

&gt;It's not ad hominem. Your willingness to throw around fallacies suggests you're not understanding those either.

How does my willingness to mention a fallacy change my understanding or it's logical value?

In debate one does not address the person or their character directly, as it always distracts from the argument. In formal debate it's penalized, even if it's not used specifically to discount their argument. It simply has no place in an argument. It serves no purpose.

Making grand assumptions about a person's character based on a scattering of writings on the internet, sometimes typed out on a phone and in a hurry, is simply unnecessary in every sense of the word. And in a debate sub is absolutely ""to the person"", ad hominem, instead of ""to the argument"".

&gt;You haven't demonstrated that, because your argument hinges on circular logic. You say it's so, so it must be so.

I am waiting for you to point out the circular logic. You said it was so, so it must be so?

&gt;This doesn't make much sense.

"	"I'm an RF engineer. The frequency at which a microwave oven operates is fixed for several reasons. One is that the frequency is optimized at the resonant frequency of the water molecule to maximize the energy transfer to the food. The second is that the magnetron is a tuned cavity resonator, so it would be impractical to modulate the frequency because its output frequency is determined by the dimensions of the cavities. The third is that the magnetron gets RF energy into the oven cavity via a waveguide and horn antenna, which is also a narrow band device if you want to transfer the maximum amount of RF power without absorbing it or reflecting it back into the source. Older microwave ovens, and some commercial ovens have a hidden ""stirrer"", which is a reflective metal fan blade that sits in the output horn of the waveguide and reflects some of the energy around the oven cavity to even up the power transfer. Other ovens use a somewhat more effective turntable to move the food instead. Some food is just really difficult to heat evenly if the water content isn't distributed in a homogeneous manner, so in that case it works better to use a lower power setting and a longer cook time. It is also better to place the food off-center on the turntable."	"Recently, Benny Snell ejection in the music city bowl.

At least the Fathier chase's nonsensically cartoonish goofiness was the exception to the film, not the norm.

At least I actually care about the characters and can see a logical progression from how the protagonists act at the beginning of the film and how they act at the end.

Plants sustain a pool of stem cells at the tips of the shoots. Differentiation is controlled by hormones; hormones generated in the roots move towards the shoots and vice versa. So the hormone auxin is moving up the plant (via protein pumps in the cell walls), and concentrating in the tips, called an ""auxin sink."" At a certain threshold, a leaf bud is formed and the cells differentiate. 
Plants can initiate leaves at 180°, either one or two leaves at a time, or in a spiral formation. The goal is to optimize surface area to expose to the light. 

To answer your question, the spiral formation is generated because the auxin ""sinks"" in the shoot tips form at the furthest place away from the last sinks.

Athena was jealous of a woman named Arachne because the woman was known to be the most talented weaver. Athena forced Arachne to compete with her in a weaving competition, and when Arachne's creation surpassed Athena's, Athena angrily turned Arachne into a spider, and her creation into her web. This is where we get the word for spiders from, and also it makes you wonder about the inscription ""weaving spiders come not here"" which is posted outside of Bohemian Grove. Athena also turned Medusa into the spider haired demon that she was known as, because she was angry at her for escaping Poseidon's rape attempts, and then she helped to kill Medusa. She also helped start the Trojan war because she was angry that Paris didn't deem her the most beautiful. "	I asked for one of these on my wedding registry.

She tried to turn it on and it sounded like it was turning on, but it stopped and didn't boot.

I just bought a new PSU (the above video is with the new PSU in) and the same thing happens. Not sure how to test the new PSU itself without any other parts. Tried multiple sockets around the house as well.

I plan to take the CPU out and check it next, but I wanted to post this asap and get any suggestions on what else I could try when I do.

"Well who determines what the natural rights are?

"	Y'all got me dying here.	"Basically comes to the fact that to be an atheist does not require you to believe there are no gods only to not believe there are gods.. It sounds weird but if someone had a box and told you there was $100 bill in the bottom you might think that is possible but it would be weird so you wouldn't believe them until you opened the box and it was in there.

At the same time you can stack up the lack of evidence and the history of God religions and the holy books full of contradictions with themselves and reality so the books and what people say has no bearing on a god existing so you wouldn't automatically believe someone who said a god exists.

You can also deduce that gods don't exist like unicorns and fairies don't exist. You don't technically know they don't exist but you have about the same level of doubt as an atheist has in a god.. and it doesn't help that all gods mentioned seem to be impossible including a god in a space outside of all space in a time before all time causing the big bang... they were nowhere at no time thus they couldn't exist.

If we are in a simulation then we don't know anything about the reality outside the simulation so there might be thousands of gods and we would never know nor would we know if it was possible.. The laws of our reality being a simulation wouldn't tell us anything about the laws of nature outside the simulation. 

We are born agnostic atheists who believe reality is real and without indoctrination we believe the same way. Some people believe in gods or the simulated reality but neither of these have proof and our original inclination might be true. Instead of trying to prove something that doesn't exist does not exist atheists just lack a belief until proven otherwise... and find a belief in gods dilusional because it requires belief without evidence and against all evidence that does exist. If a god does in deed exist and an afterlife as well all we can do is hope that god isn't a complete asshole for punishing us for not believing in him/her/It. I don't believe in an afterlife either so Hell doesn't scare me into belief... I'm saying if I'm blindsided after death finding out I'm wrong then I would have expected a god who can judge me would have shown they existed if they expected me to believe in their existence.

I will gladly change my mind with compelling evidence and if a god exists that is all powerful and all knowing who wants me to know about them they'd know what to do and do it. Any evidence that holds up to scientific scrutiny or a god literally coming down to earth for everyone to see would probably do it. 

I am an agnostic atheist with a lot of doubt in a god but at the same time I don't know that I'm right enough to disprove all possible gods., I can disprove attributes or religions pretty easily though so I won't use those to start believing."

"The goal of pretty much every Amish woman is to get married by the time she is 21 years old.  If one is not married or at least has a steady partner by that time the chances of getting married grow slim. If an Amish woman does not get married she remains living at home with her parents until they pass away then usually she will live with a married brother. 

If a woman does not marry she is usually a maid for married women who need help. Women do not have career opportunities. Some may bake, make candy, make noodles or quilt to bring in extra income but it is usually limited.

Amish date, a boy will have another boy ask a friend of the girl he likes to ask her if he can take her home after the singing. If she says yes then the boy will take her home and they will visit in the living room or kitchen until about 1 am. If the boy likes the girl he will ask if he can take her home after the next singing, if not then he will ask someone else. After a few dates in a row a couple is considered steady.

My go-tos for summer are dresses (to the knee or max a couple  inches above), polyester sleeveless blouses with a cardigan and whatever slacks are currently in style (BR has some cute crop ones that I wear. I'm so glad boot cut is out). 

Shoe-wise I wear ballet flats,loafers, and some patent leather shoes with velvet laces. I'm tall so heels make me super stand out, so I stick to flats.

Fish is beneficial for personal health, and a mainstay source of food for humans in general for god knows how long. Cigs are sticks of toxic chemicals that some large corporations sell despite them having 0 benefits to the consumer just so they get addicted to them and keep buying them. 

The production process of fish is salvageable, and the individual impact of anyone consuming it has no real impact on anything, only the combined effect. For cigs one person consuming has a real impact on that person, as well as the environment through littering but lets ignore that for the time being. 

There is no justification for smoking besides 'I've been doing it since it wasn't known to be cancer sticks and now I'm too addicted and not strong willed enough to stop', there are plenty of justifications for humans continuing to eat fish. The fish process can be improved to a point where it's not environmentally unethical to consume, the consumption of cigs will always be 100% a negative for both the world and the person smoking.

I do drink and I'm aware that when police become involved with people using alcohol it is not for the mere fact they are using it (which is the case with pot) they are responding in the most part to violence and behavior endangering the drinker or others. I'm also aware of the unacceptably high rates of injury, disease and death caused by alcohol. It is a bad drug and I suggest people that haven't used it make a decision not to. By no means though do I want it banned. 

I also smoke. I am also well aware of the unacceptably high rates of disease and death caused by tobacco use. Whilst I wouldn't mind tobacco gradually being made less available and eventually illegal I don't want it banned any time soon as to do so would not only create a huge black market it would make criminals out of honest people. No good law does that. 

Like you I am also aware that most people who use pot smoke it, which is creating a ticking time bomb of negative health outcomes and death. I am also aware that like nearly all mind and mood altering substances the vast majority of people who use it will do so without negative consequences in their day to day life. If you can give someone a guarantee that they will be in this majority I encourage you to evangelize the use of pot. If not perhaps you should remember that for healthy people pot has no benefits but may have negative physical and mental health consequences ranging from very mild to extremely serious, including death. Just like alcohol and tobacco though I don't want it outlawed. You're right though, fuck me for suggesting people avoid a substance with real and known negative consequences for a significant minority of users.

Riteaid and other standalone pharmacies usually charge 2x the price.

CVS might have loss leaders that drag you into the store, but I'm reluctant to think that anything there is worth buying.

"	"Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son’s name, If you know? Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. Proverbs 30:4‭-‬6 NKJV

Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. John 3:10‭-‬13 NKJV

No one has ever gone to heaven and returned. But the Son of Man has come down from heaven. John 3:13 NLT Here's another translation.

Don't let the devil shake your faith by misunderstanding. Don't take that passage out of context. Jesus is speaking about their teachings and authority and how he can speak these things about heaven and God because He is a witness for them.

I reached out because what you're going through reminded me of my ex husband( see what I mean about pulling from own experiences?) He had money ( due to an inheritance) and that was HIS money ( ok. that makes sense to me) but all our bills were 50/50. He was a car salesman so if he decided he wanted to quit, he would. He wouldn't work for 2 months at a time, while I busted my butt and we paid things 50/50. He didn't even want to do joint taxes because even thought theres a payoff, I owed some money( less than 300 dollars), which would mean it would of been taken out of the total. So I paid the 300 and he got his normal tax refund in the mail. I know that a lot of people will say - well, what's wrong with that?  And I guess, maybe to another woman nothing at all. But I knew that by keeping things equal, it really wasn't equal at all. I knew I didnt want a family with him.

The idea that if everyone decides to play nice and not become the first aggressors then the world can become a better place. Ideologically speaking it's just communism with guns the only difference is everyone gets the same opportunities to achieve instead of the same material wealth. Libertarianism is naturally egalitarian because it doesn't as a pure theory account for natural inequalities, namely intelligence.


In practice therefore due to natural inequalities the top bracket will end up earning enough to buy up all the land and then rent it out to others and then you have people to manage  payments and you end up with government all over again.

The reason racial and spiritual elements need to be considered is the same reason you go out of your way to get your mother nice Christmas presents every year  because as a rule of thumb you like to protect and help people that are like yourself.

Call it latent narcissism but that's one reason why interracial kids are so rare despite the overabundance in advertising because we want to be surrounded by people who are like themselves and similar kids are the closest thing we have to immortality.

If we have people different to each other in society we can't trust each other so resentment grows from the lower beings so assuming equality equates that he is being somehow tricked and reacts violently feeling cheated out of whatever. 

Similarly the higher being still has the option to exploit the lower one or in a more modern context the higher beings can exploit the lower elements of society and by manipulating their lesser cognitive abilities blame their oppression on a different group taking the heat of themselves and in doing so increase their market share of societal domination by having the lower beings drag down the competing groups.


TLDR: when people group up they act like assholes to other groups and whatever happens people group up so instead of simple wealth extraction we should separate the groups so they won't be assholes to each other."

* **Mission: Impossible - Fallout** \- After a long long time there's finally a single overall winner in the Mission: Impossible Franchise as Fallout dethroned Mission: Impossible II to become the highest grossing M:I film domestically with $216M. That now makes the film both the highest grossing M:I film domestically and worldwide as it looks to become the first one to cross $800M worldwide. Of course Fallout crossing $215M in 2018 is a much different feat than M:I 2 crossing that same number in 2000. In some ways it speaks to the way Cruise's star has wained but it also shows that despite that the M:I films have something special about them that keeps them running well into their second decade of existence.

**Notable film closings**

* **Avengers: Infinity War** \- After a crazy 25 week run the massive culmination of the 10 year MCU experiment has closed to a phenomenal $678.8M domestic and $2.04B worldwide on a budget of $315M - $400M.  Even though it just barely ended up below Black Panther domestically, the film was just unstoppable overseas becoming the fourth highest grossing film worldwide and the sixth film to gross $1B in overseas gross alone. The film which stars...everyone was something of an unbelievable dream just ten years ago when the first Iron Man teased the idea of the Avengers but it's a real testament to the skill Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers have to manage to not make a truly catastrophic mess of a film. It will be interesting to see if Avengers 4 can deliver in the same global event level way or even top Infinity War. But whether it is a slight downturn (in what world does Avengers 4 not easily make at least $1.5B?) or a jump up the experiment is officially a massive success. In ten years Feige and co have built the most consistently performing franchise in history. Where it goes from here will be fascinating, but this is the kind of success that comes very very rarely and should be praised.
* **Tag -**  The film based on a true story closed this week to a pretty good $54.5M domestic and $77.7M worldwide on a budget of $28M. The true story of a group of friends who played a real life decades long game of tag was turned into a true story based film that scored okay with critics but opened surprisingly high and held well. It's been a good year for studio comedies with solid hits like Blockers and Game Night earlier in the year, though those were not based on true stories. By the way did you know that Tag is based on a true story? Cause it is!
* **Uncle Drew -**  The latest in the at least two film trend of popular advertisements starring basketball stars turning into full feature films closed this week to a solid $42.4M domestic and $44.3M worldwide on a budget $18M. The film based on the popular Pepsi ad campaign starring Kyrie Irving had a roster full of real life basketball stars in old age makeup. Despite the bizarre existence of the film it scored solid reviews and held on well, but didn't get much of an overseas release. Perhaps this will finally pave the way for my musical biopic of Jose Lima based on the Casa Ole commercials (hell yeah extremely local and outdated references!)

He changed and I think into the direction where his vows are gone. I really wanna know, how he'll react if he finds out who his real parents were. Maybe he even wants to become king from this point.

Are you not able to see it?


&gt;Let me ask you this, Do you believe there is currently a war of soft censorship on non-mainstream media right now? Being in the tech world, i can show you how these things work.

This is not even partially related to this discussion. We are talking about THIS particular bill in congress and what it does. It does not do what you said, it is a legal bill full of legal jargon. It has nothing near what all that SOPA PIPA or others garbage had in it which was vague and unclear. This one is very clear and very specific with a target goal in-mind. This argument is irrelevant to this discussion and it is not even sponsored by all the same congressmen. This is one of the good bills and knee jerk reactions are not helpful here. I can't remember the saying, but it goes something like after fighting for a while or being paranoid for some time, eventually everything is perceived as an enemy or a threat. This is a dangerous way to view the world and the internet will not be censored due to this bill. We aren't trying to protect criminals with our ""freedom of speech"" I would hope. I only care to protect shitposting on Reddit and other similar things.

Even if you think stock prices are rigged in the short term no one is rigging the profits of major companies. Eventually those profits become all that matters in the returns of the stock, along with the price you bought the stock at. If bankers are somehow driving down the price of a price below what it should be based on it's long term prospects then buy it, hold it, and profit. If they are driving it up then short it. Or recognize that your entire premise is faulty and stock prices aren't being manipulated, because if they were then this sort of arbitrage would cause the prices to rapid return to normal.

Advice includes ; 

1. **“Suicide is selfish.”** This inspires more guilt. Two points are important here. One, many people who seriously consider suicide actually think they are burdening their family by staying alive. So, in their distressed, perhaps even mentally ill state of mind, they would be helping their loved ones by freeing them of this burden. Two, isn’t it a natural response to excruciating pain to think of escaping the torment? (I write more about this in my post, [“Is It Selfish to Die in a Tornado?”](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/10/28/is-it-selfish/))
2. **“Suicide is cowardly.”** This inspires shame. It also does not really make sense. Most people fear death. While I hesitate to call suicide brave or courageous, overcoming the fear of death does not strike me as cowardly, either.

As without doing so you may be doing more harm than good.

I speak from experience regarding these matters and through ignorance have said the wrong things as have many others. It's not a nice feeling having done so because the results can be devastating and lives with you for the rest of your life. I wouldn't wish you to have share  experience just because of a few misjudged words through lack of information and understanding.

I hope you view this as constructive criticism and not a personal attack on your beliefs opinions  a belief you had the best intentions it is just advice offered  as result of personal experience and learning.

What an animal would do to me is irrelevant. Animals don't have a choice in what they eat to survive, but we do. We also have moral agency that I would argue holds us to a higher standard.

Also, the case study part should probably also not be hidden behind a drawer but start out expanded.

They think his skill set is better suited to a different position. This idea that people don't want him to play QB because he's black is weird and I don't really get where it comes from.

"A few years back I was just starting work at this not so great paying job, still hurting from the joblessness, and I went in to get gas. The gas station was kind of a mob scene, and it took like 20 minutes to get to the register and everyone was just kind of annoyed and a little rudish. I got to the front of the line and asked for $5.00 in gas, which at the time was like $4.00 a gallon. I think I had to use a dollar in quarters too. Just enough to get to work where I would get paid and get more gas later.

I was pumping gas and finished and put the pump back when it immediately beeped and said ""prepaid $10"" on the screen. I assumed it was an accident and started to get in my car when this woman starts screaming from across the parking lot and waving her hands ""You've got extra gas! You got 10$ more!"". I thought she was trying to say that she accidentally put the 10$ on my pump and thought I pumped it (I didn't). She kept saying it like that for a  few more times and finally walked closer and said ""I paid for $10 more gas for you!"" which is when it hit me, she didn't do it by accident, she was trying to give me a break and help me out.

She explained that she knows how little gas $5.00 is and how she's had to buy just enough gas for the day before too, and just thought I was really polite even though the whole store was full of angry people. I teared up and thanked her profusely.

It made my day and I've never forgotten it. I think of her probably every time I pump gas. I've since paid it forward in similar ways and those small acts of generosity really show on peoples faces when you can tell they are struggling. I always wished I had her contact information so I could pay her back, or show her my appreciation somehow."	Oh shi-! Woops lol.	Fine people on both sides!

The first major goal of replacing fossil fuels will occur within the industrial sector anyways! Large corporations as well as governments will have to lead the way in the change.

 **TLDR at the bottom**


My parents met in a treatment center, got married, and had me. They both wound up relapsing and eventually got divorced. They were in and out of recovery, cleaning up and then relapsing again and again. 

My mom was cheating with another man from NA and they wound up getting married shortly after my parents split. During this time, I would see my dad every Wednesday and every other weekend. I remember being 6 years old, my dad woke me up in the middle of the night, we got in the car, and he drove down to the ghetto part of the city. He left me in the car and went into a drug house to buy crack. Another time when I slept over, I was eating a HoHo and I couldn't wake my dad up. I fell asleep hysterical and woke up to a melted HoHo in my hand.

My mom and her 2nd husband got divorced and she was still using. When I was 8, my maternal grandma became my guardian while my mom was away at a treatment center. That didn't last long though. My mom married her 3rd husband who had a lot of money and I wound up being placed back with my mom. 

When I was 10, my dad broke into my maternal grandmas house, stole her pain medication and her car. From what I understand, he was on a binge. Anyway, my grandma didn't know it was my dad, she called the police, and they found and arrested him. My grandma tried to drop charges but the state prosecuted. He wound up serving 4 years...and I'm glad he did. At least he was clean.

My mom was married to her 3rd husband and relapsed several times. She was emotionally abusive and unstable which made for a rocky childhood. When I was 14, I was placed with my maternal grandma again and became her foster child. Every 3 months we would go to court to see if my parents did what was asked of them. Either they didn't do it or didn't show up. Throughout middle school and high school I cut myself, was hospitalized 3 times for suicidal ideation, and diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Eventually, the suicidal thoughts lessened and I was doing well.

Eventually my mom and her 3rd husband divorced, both my parents relapsed, got clean, relapsed again, went to jail, etc.

In December 2010, my mom was in jail for not paying driving tickets. Over the phone, she told me she had changed and was different...that she wanted to do better. My grandma and I let her move in and it was good for a while...until she started stealing my grandma's pain medication.

While my mom was living with us, she told me how she was an escort when I was around 8-11 years old and during that time, she was using heroin (her primary drug were opiate prescriptions). She also told me that she was held at gun point while buying medication from downtown. Due to her using again, we had to kick her out. Though, I still talked to her on the phone and see her once in a while.

On May 9th, 2011, my mom called me to say goodnight. She liked to do weird things to show she loved me so, while talking on the phone, she said she was going to call me later in the night to leave me a cute voicemail (She did stuff like this a lot). The next morning I woke up and went to work. While at work, I kept getting a phone call from a random number. I finally answered and it was the police asking if I was the daughter of Lynn (name I'll use for my mom). I said yes and they told me she was in the hospital. I figured it was just another OD and she was fine. However, the police told me it didn't look good.
I picked my grandma up and we went to the hospital. She was staying at a guys house and he had left with his son to go to the doctor. When he got back, he found my mom face down next to the coffee table, unresponsive. My mom was hooked up to all these machines, she was bloated...it wasn't real. She was brain dead and died May 11th, 2011. I listened to her voicemail and found what seemed to be her suicide note written in her NA book.

The day my mom died I told my dad he needed to get help and find a way back to recovery. His response? ""Don't worry, I know how much I can handle.""
About a month later, my dad found his girlfriend of about 12 years dead in their bedroom from an overdose.

My dad and I were finally starting to form the relationship I always wanted. One night, I was at a friend's and he called me. We talked for a few minutes, my dad was a talker...he would never shut up! I told him I'd call him back and I even set an alarm on my phone to remind me. On July 11th, 2011 at 1:30PM my alarm went off to remind me. I didn't feel like talking to my dad at the moment, so I didn't call. My aunt called me and let me know she needed to talk...I figured she was calling to let me know my uncle died (he had lung cancer). However, she's the one who told me they found my dad dead in his home. Cause of death was several factors, including morphine in his system.


I still deal with the fact that both of my parents are dead. I still deal with the guilt even though I know that there is nothing I could have done. I don't know if I forgive them yet. I'm not sure I've even 100% accepted the fact they're gone. Fact of the matter is, you never know how much time you have with the ones you love, even if that relationship is strained. 


TL;DR: My parents met in rehab, had many relapses, overdosed and died within two months to the day of eachother, and I don't know if I've fully come to terms with the fact they're never coming back. However, being brought up in that environment, being diagnosed with depression/anxiety, and experiencing those losses inspired me to become a social worker."	I would love this. Honestly I'm just bored of making myself flashy. I struggle to just look normal now.	"You may not have liked Echoes but to me was even more impressive a game when you consider how poor and strange Gaiden is. Conquest has great gameplay but its story and characters really hurt my enjoyment of it. The Fates games overall are the direction I really don't like seeing Fire Emblem go.

The voice acting, art direction, and small changes to the writing of the original Gaiden deserve a whole hell of a lot of praise in Echoes.

I personally hope we can get both kinds of games in the future and for me I hope the Switch game is some kind of mix of Echoes production values, Conquest gameplay, and Tellius storytelling and characters.

2. And since Jesus didn't just whisk himself back to heaven but instead...
3. Showed up in the flesh so they had evidence of his resurrection (Mt. 28; Mk. 16; Lk. 24; Jn. 20; Acts 1; 1 Cor. 15.1-6)...
4. And since they had a chance to watch him eat (Lk. 24.40-43) and to touch him to know he was real (Lk. 24.38-39; Jn. 20.27)...
5. Then we should be able to assume they were in a position to know for a fact that Jesus had truly risen.

After all, it's not personal experiences that are unreliable. If they are always unreliable, we have to doubt all science, journalism, and courtroom proceedings. It's not personal experience that is the problem, but unreliable personal experience. So let's examine the disciples.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The disciples fully believe they had seen the risen Jesus in the flesh. They had real visual experiences of some sort. They were certain that Jesus in the flesh had impinged on their visual field.
2. The disciples' lives were all transformed after this visual experience. What they believe they saw was life-changing for them.
3. An educational or religious experience does not adequately explain the change we see in every one of these men.
4. The message of the disciples was both founded and grounded in a physical resurrection that they themselves had seen the evidence of with their very eyes. In their preaching they repeat over and over that they were witnesses of these things.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what places them in a position to know these things. But were they fooled? Fooled by what?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wrong tomb. Idiots went to the wrong tomb and were fooled into thinking Jesus rose. This is too easy to prove wrong. A mistake like this lasts about an hour.
2. Hallucination. Poor guys wanted to see him so bad they had visions. The problem with this is it doesn't explain all the appearances, it doesn't fit James (the brother of Jesus) who wasn't a believer until after the resurrection, group hallucinations are impossible and unknown, and it doesn't explain the conversion of Paul, a hostile.
3. Were they fooled by an imposter? Jesus's unknown twin brother perhaps? We know about Anastasia Nikolaevna, and how difficult it was for her to pull off the imposter game. It's hard to fool the people who know you best. But this twin would have had to put holes in his hands and feet. Not plausible.
4. Were they influenced and fooled by tricksters? Who might the perpetrators of such a prank be? Mary Magdalene, the first person to see Jesus? Hardly. She didn't have that kind of influence. Peter? He had the prominence, but he was in a group every time he saw Jesus except once. Not probable. Paul? At the time he was not a believer and was not trusted.

It's not plausible that they were fooled. The conclusion is that the disciples were in a good position to know for a fact that Jesus had risen from the dead."

There is a trade off when a pancreas transplant is done.

Therefore, it is obviously not for every patient with diabetes.

&gt; I think the majority of it is that he’s very accepting of the takedown. He cares, right. He obviously prefers not to be on his back, and when he gets taken down, he doesn’t panic. We saw him grapple for extended periods of time against Werdum, and that’s not an easy thing to do. He’s comfortable there, but when you’re on your back like that, you’re losing, and in a short fight, fifteen minutes, a guy racks up two rounds and you don’t finish him, you end up losing to a guy you may be potentially better than.


I can relate to that so much. Idk if it was my long time in just BJJ that made me so comfortable on my back that I lost my explosiveness, but something did. It's really frustrating now that I'm trying to improve my MMA. My TDD kinda sucks cause I immediately trigger for a guillotine which I do get sometimes but when I don't I end up on my back eating shots while I threaten a submission or two. When I decide it's time to get up I'm a little gassed and spent all this time on the ground already not really advancing anything, damage or otherwise. My brain/instinct isn't to explode up like wrestler.

Sometimes I think it would've been smarter to do wrestling instead of BJJ for so long. Idk tho I'm here. Anyone got any tips for working on that explosiveness? Thnx

 On the other hand I did get a sick ass flying/sitting armbar yesterday against a wrestler who got a little too comfortable with the collar-tie. And a gogoplata as well. So I don't regret BJJ cause I'm dirty on the ground. I just wish I could get up when I wanted to. "	There is absolutely nothing more I need to see.

I wanted to ask you the following questions: what would you suggest for someone who has many suicidal thoughts for the past years but just cannot tell anybody?

As a backstory, I have been absolutely miserable for the past years but this year is the worst by far. I have never been like this before. I never told anyone, because of my past experience. Back in highschool, I had a similar period where it ended up in a lot of selfharm. However when discovered by my family, their reaction was rather violent with me, and I was told to grow up and immediately stop. I love my family, I know they should have done better, but this is what our society teaches us, seeking mental help is a big source of ""Shame"" ( I am not from the US). Fast forward some years, I am now engaged to the girl I see my future with, and I love her. I can sense she is very disappointed as she just says that I should keep being hopeful and that everything is going to be ok, or sometimes she gets sad because she thinks that I don't love her enough to  move forward from this ""temporary period"" in my life. This, of course is not true and I explained to her several times that it wasn't related to her and it just sickens me even more. So I gave up talking to her about this specific subject.
I have decided since not to talk to anybody about this, not even friends or relatives because I look like I am just asking for attention. 
The only reasons I asked you this is because: first, this Reddit and I am anonymous and second, I really liked your answer for other questions and would love to have your opinion on this.

Being ""bad in bed"" could mean they skip foreplay, they jackhammer away the whole time, they try going in dry, they attempt anal without asking, they don't listen to you etc. etc. There's a plethora of things that make a man bad in bed. Not having a ""magic penis"" isn't one.

Both sexes have the pressure to be sexually perfect.

As someone who has been playing since launch day I was very happy with the changes (not so much the speed that they were coming) but I saw progress. The whole engine rewrite, the scripting fixes and improvements plus the AMAZING changes to battleye to clamp down on cheaters. After playing for a while I took a break for about a year to let them put some new content for when I ""rediscover"" the game.

The Good:

I can say without a doubt that 0.63 fixed so many of the things I had issues with. I like the new crosshair and bullet mechanics (I know a lot of you don't but shooting from cover was near impossible before). Melee combat is now viable and a single zombie usually isn't a threat however a group of them at once is a bad situation. The eating and crafting animations as well as cooking with a clear timer and time based use amount also address a lot of immersion and animation lock issues of the past. No more eating a can of beans prone and then being forced to stand in the middle of a field when someone is shooting at you.

The bad:
Your food and water are consumed way to quickly when sprinting. The game was already a running simulator but now it's a jogging simulator because if you want to get anywhere fast youll starve or dehydrate well before.

Cars are still pointless (I understand they arn't in 0.63) you need that specific wheel and that specific plug and that specific battery etc. I understand realism but at a certain point it just becomes anti fun. As well as the whole shifting mechanic and the fact that cars just felt like I was driving a whale that was lubed up and sent down a slip and slide

The ugly:
The sprinting + weight system is so horribly done. 80% of dayz is looting, 10% is character maintenance, 5% taking on zombies, 3% suicide for better spawn, 2% PVP. As of now I see no point to get better gear when I barely get the basics and half my sprinting ability is gone. Either modify the weight multiplier for sprint time and when you can no longer sprint or make strength a soft skill that quickly levels. The way it stands 80% of the game isn't even doable because of this sprint/carrying issue.

Would love to hear what the community thinks and how attitudes/opinions may have changed since I last played.

Both Chad Mendes but espacially Eddie (who is  more known for his standup then for his wrestling) are not even close to the level of wrestling as Khabib. Also Eddie said in a post fight interview that he didn't stick to the gameplan at all. 
You probably think that Khabib will stand with Conor like Eddie and Chad did, but Khabib said he will wrestlefuck Conor immediately and will not stand with him for a second. 
So you may think well maybe Conor can catch Khabib coming in. Except that chance is so extremely small because Khabib times his takedowns really well. And what if Conor doesn't catch Khabib coming in (what is by far the most realistic thing to happen) then what does he do. Look what happened with Barboza, Dos Anjos, Michael Johnson, Abel Trujillo they all have way higher wrestling, takedown defence and Bjj than Conor has and they got MAULED. so don't just say Conor will catch  Khabib coming in (because the chance of that happening is very very small) but instead think of what will happen if Conor doesn't catch him coming in."

"Tahm Kench is my most played champion; I'm very familiar with his mechanics.

The difference between my clip and Trick2G's is that: 1) I was tanking two consecutive Nexus tower shots at once, 2) I don't have 40% CDR like Trick did, and 3) Udyr's Turtle stance actually gives him so much sustain + Spirit Visage + a Red buff (to a lesser extent) since he was healing off of minions.

I think this movie looks bad. The rooftop chase seemed really slow. The armored guy chasing Mera (Black Manta? I could only see his back) seemed to run through the same room twice and Amber Hurd runs weird. The CGI looked meh and Mamoa's dude-bro schtick doesn't appeal to me. 

But that underwater war seemed promising.

"In addition to a local backup to a NAS you should also backup that NAS to a cloud backup service. The Synology Diskstation NAS officially supports the IDrive online backup service which offers 2 TB of backup storage for $69 a year or 5TB for $99 a year. Backblaze is another good backup service that is supported on the Synology but becomes more expensive than IDrive for anything over 1TB.

QNAP is another highly rated NAS that officially supports IDrive and Backblaze cloud backup services along with a few others.

I believe you asked this in another forum but I'll answer it here for anyone reading this thread.  Double depression is another name for dysthymic disorder. Dysthymia is a long-term chronic, depressed mood accompanied by one or two other symptoms of clinical depression.

https://www.sharecare.com/health/depression/what-is-double-depression

Talk therapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressants (ask your doctor for a clinical consult) are generally an effective treatment for dysthymic disorder. In addition to finding a therapist that feels like a good fit, you may want to get to the doctor for a physical and blood work to rule out any underlying biological causes that may be causing these symptoms.

Im not the jealous type and he can hang out with other girls, but he he is now getting their phone numbers from girls he doesn't know. Just the other day he went up to a girl when we were walking around town and got her number on paper, smirked and came back to me. He wrinkled up the paper and threw it away and said maybe Ill keep it next time if he sees me talking to any attractive men! What I don't get is that he and my best friend have talked and it seems like they are on good terms! At this point I don't even know if he cheated.

Out of the 5 defensive positions, there's only 2 players that I have confidence in. And that's on top of missing the only defensive midfielder we have for the first and most important game. 

RB: Rezaiean- looks like he's dropped off from his form last year. Leaves so much space in behind now when he bombs up the pitch. Should be great for when we face Alba. 

CB: Cheshmi - Dreadful. not even the second best CB in my club team yet Quieroz has not only called him up but is also starting him in the recent friendlies. Luckily, the other two CBs of my club also got called up and are much better than he is, hopefully they get to start instead. 

GK: Beiranvand: awful. 

CB: Pouraliganji. Been a rock at the back for us over the years, solid.

LB: Milad: Solid. Bit rough around the edges, but the least of our worries. 

This is the sort of time that I need to remind myself that Quieroz knows infinitely more than I do and there's surely good reasoning behind the omissions and selections even if it's difficult to see. Just annoying to see one of our most instrumental/experienced/solid players in qualifying get left out, and also another player who is one of the best players in my club team get left out for seemingly nothing. Rezaei who performed so well in Belgium also got seriously shafted in my opinion.

I was past 5 days so what gives? I also noticed I wasn't as confident even though I finally past a week.

"In a semi-well functioning system like we have the unions knows that asking for a lot more than what is possible won't work.

Instead those teaching your kids are the rest of the bunch and uninspired, no desire or passion or joy to be a good worker and just do their job and nothing more. Don't try to inspire or anything.

Another problem is the fact that a lot of trucking companies don't want the work. Most of the back of nowhere hauling is done by owner operators.

"By the same token can you be a born disbeliever?

The reasons/problems I have with it:

* Maybe it's just me, but I think the price is absurd, given the fact that you don't even get a full set for each character but have to swap it around manually or buy/use expensive shared inventory slots.
* Also regarding the price: You would get for example two seasons of the story for less gems.
* I get it, that it is mainly a convenience item but with charges of 50 respectively 100 the standard tools aren't out THAT fast and also don't use inventory space (except you bring spares of course)
* I am really struggling convincing myself to buy them mainly because of the high price. With the current ingame prices that would be nearly 35 Euros - the same I paid for PoF Deluxe.....

Just to make it clear: I played GW2 in 2012 and stopped. Just returned after several years, so I don't have much gold. Therefore I refer to buying this set with real money and not by exchanging gold for gems, like perhaps many ppl do.

I would be very interested in your thoughts regarding this, and perhaps I overlooked something but in the current state I don't think I will buy some of these tools. Instead I probably will indeed buy two seasons of the story - maybe a better investment?

Thanks in advance for your answers!"	Was just hoping it was forza.	"I was watching Democracy Now with a former victim of a pedophile priest.

There are a few things I don't use often enough to warrant a whole keybind for, and they're in another hidden actionbar in a very conspicuous place.

Modern kids can still be just as well-spoken and educated as the ones in the video. They're probably from an excellent school.

Also getting enough rest is important. between sets, night and rest days.

What matters is the music, we are talking about musicians. When they are alive, they can play their music live for people, that is what people want. When they are dead, that is gone and no holograms can change that. Prince is never performing again. They are going to play a recording of his voice and have someone sing along with him. That is it.

Obesity rates in the US are higher than avg countries, but Western Europe isn't too much behind. According to WHO, US overweight proportion is 3/4, where avg for Europe is 65%. US obesity rates are in the low to mid 30% depending on the state, but the UK is sitting at 2t% and Germany at 20%. Compared to the 2-4% in Korea and Japan, yall are as much fatasses as we are. Obesity is a big problem in the US due to overconsumption, portion sizes, and food desertification, not so much people's ability to do math.

The point is, that the essence of what is the point of reference is not useful in a wide set of cases. I don't need to compare oj and milk by ml, I can just check the carton sizes with another metric and get the same result. As well, they don't mean anything outside of context: both serve different dietary needs. And even THEN, the point goes into solids like where i reallg piunted out the issue: comparing 100ml if almonds to chips doesn't mean much. Even then, food data like calorie counts and proportions can be off by as much as 15%, and that can get really out of control if you use small measurement proportions."

"Ok but the amount of pollution from straws and butts are minuscule compared to industrial pollutants and plastic compounds from other sources and that's a fact by the way.

Leviticus is the laws of the Jews and if you are going to commit to those particular verses then you must also commit to all of the other laws there as well. A handful of others being:


Leviticus 18:19 You shall not approach a woman to have intercourse with her while she is in her menstrual uncleanliness 


Leviticus 19:27-28 Do not clip your hair at the temples, nor spoil the edges of your beard. Do not lacerate your bodies for the dead, and do not tattoo yourselves.


Leviticus 20:18 If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and has intercourse with her, he has laid bare the source of her flow and she has uncovered it. The two of them shall be cut off from the people.


There are many more laws that are stated in Leviticus. I have not seen any protestant group follow all the laws in Leviticus. If you are relying solely on those laws, then heed them all or be labeled a hypocrite for picking and choosing. "	I specifically remember Ajit Pai saying this will lead to more competition.

Beyond the fact that our roads have pot holes that eat moderate sized cars, driving here is a kin to mad max and therefore bikes (motorized or not) are sketchy AF. We also have hills where if you aren't able to go up them at speed you're going to experience the mad max vibe. My mom has a diesel VW bug that will go straight up a tree, but it isn't doing it quickly. Flat out up some of the ""large"" hills here it's doing maybe 25 (speed limits 35+), you'll be almost run off the road by cars flying past you up hill. Forget it on a bike of any kind.


Beyond that, if you have to take high ways a 50cc motor on a bike is both not going to be fast enough and is very illegal in most places. So sure, you could avoid high ways but that turns a 25 minute commute into something much much longer. I just looked up my commute and my wife's, 30-40 minutes using the high ways. If you want to avoid high ways, as you would have to on a bike, you're looking at an hour and a half. 


It's not about a lack of motivation, straight up bikes arent practical in many places or for most people. I could ride a bike, sorta sketch-illy, to where I teach but 8 miles one way means I'm getting there stinky and dirty. So sure I could shower at the university but now I've turned a short commute via car into a hour + long bike ride and the need to shower before work. Basically I've tripled my commute time under the best circumstances. 


Bikes are great. If you live in a city where you can commute via bike it's awesome. If you live somewhere that slapping a 50cc motor on your bike is safe, legal, and efficient that's awesome and I'm envious of you. Anywhere I've lived that is either illegal (motor on the bike) or massively unsafe."	Since Mace is barely competent, Littlefinger would have gotten really rich.

"	"I can't thank you enough kind stranger. I'm sure as time passes it'll get easier. I'm just fighting off the urge to contact her back. She's left me voicemails that I've ignored... trying to be strong. 

And yes. Joe's great. No judgement from that guy. Just good vibes. "	"Reading that and looking from an outside perspective, your husband seems to be selfish and lack empathy. He wanted to leave you for her and told you while you were 8 months pregnant with his child, regardless of how that would affect you. Whenever she didn't reciprocate he decided to just have everything go back to normal. That's so beyond selfish I can't even fathom how he could justify that to himself other than he literally doesn't care how his actions affect YOU, only about his own well being.

I would be very weary of going forward like this because it's not a matter of if but when he's going to decide to throw you under the bus again on his own selfish whim. If you being 8 months pregnant gives him no pause, I doubt there's little else that would stop him from absolutely destroying you emotionally in the future for his own selfish gain. I really think you should stand up for youself before that happens. "	"You mean this guy is fighting for our rights by standing up against the NRA, right?

So probably no one will ever bother."	"You're  right. Dustin's hand was clearly on
the mat when the first knee hit. Herb should have

Did you at least.... clean it before you used it? 	Do you even know anything about the Nationals?	"Trump is not a billionaire. He's a con man that has overstated his wealth all his life. 

His business dealings usually end up losing money and he will use any chance he gets to swindle some money.

Return is what you file.	I occasionally make exceptions for federal agencies. There is a $5000 fee on top though. 	"I've lived there. Small towns out in the middle of nowhere with nothing but endless orange dirt and rocks. This furore over melting roads? I used to walk home from the bus and be an inch taller from where the road had stuck to my shoes.  
I'm not suggesting an empty field where people work in the impossibly hot sun and leave everything open to the elements. I am talking about a significant, concerted effort to actually get a real greenhouse project working in some of these towns. Something more akin to a factory warehouse size, fully enclosed, recycled water, the whole works. It's the 21st century and we need to start actually implementing some of the new developments. It would be an expensive investment, but if hundreds were purchased and installed by a specific taskforce we could keep the costs down. Heck, just make it an actual government owned project with locals being paid as official gardeners if the community doesn't want to help. I would love for tax dollars to be going towards something like that rather than some of these wastes of money I see."	Sadly it's totally believed as an absolute truth on this sub. I've never seen a single man be used as a scapegoat for every single possible issue. 	Tom Moore maybe?	This part cracks me up every time.	You should have seen 30 year old me.

Fairly inanimate.	"You're not very familiar with cults are you? Their premises are often pretty ridiculous but with a bit of charisma and a few good-looking concepts you can make followers do anything. Money is often less of a motivator for the leadership then just sheer power over people.  
Paul's attempts to establish his ""the church is gods representative on Earth"" is pretty much a dead giveaway."	Idk why the downvotes. This is exactly what I was thinking. Shit happens, move on.	Where in the world did you come to that conclusion? You don't all have to be equal to have liberty. Sure equality is maybe the goal but poor people can have just as much personal liberty as rich people. But currently the government criminalizes marijuana use which is disproportionately targeting the poor.	From one shit pizza to another. Maybe the owners of Pizza hut would keep their mouth shut. 	Not fighter planes, but bomber planes. Imagine that they could easily carpet bomb shiganshina without any resistance from eldians. Imagine they're doing that for days until everything crumbled to dust just like what happened to London in WW2.	Dang, that's nice! I guess this photo clears up how the white backgrounds achieved then. Thanks!	Can confirm, both my parents are great cooks, I grew up eating healthy and still do (mostly).

"Another fun KU football tidbit is that Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. we're our starting CBs in 2008 when we won the Orange Bowl.Those two have been the best CB duo in their league for the better part of 10 years. 

Also during that 2008 season Talib, Harris and a few other football players, got into a brawl with the Morris Twins. Stories differ on who won depending on who you ask , but I have hard time believing that the Morris Twins and who ever else they were with, could take out Aqib Talib.

I was thinking about the last 10 years I was addicted to PMO this morning... calling it waste. I needed this my man. You got me getting your back if you ever need it.	7.5 what?	Sooo… no definition of what property owners consider making a living? Like buying in abundance at low rates, repairing cheap or not at all, supplying as little comfort as possible and then passing everything single cent on to their tenants including their high profit margin. Ok then, everyone in Calif already knows the deal, thus, prop 10 will pass.	What about a forklift?	"So I'm not gonna sugar coat this whole event, back in 2016 before I graduated college I was sitting in my classroom surrounded by all of my classmates. Eager to get home we were all making chit chat, I decided to look out the big window in the back and noticed that one of our class mates (a really big girl) was already heading home. So in an effort to keep the chat going I said ""*oh look Jenny is already going home*"", every single person in the room looked out the window and noticed the huge person walking away. But then I hear Jenny sitting in front of me say ""No I'm not...."""	Amon, what have you done this time?.	Yeah, but why would that make someone hesitate to date you?

Hey look its another comment about how we haven't played against any competition.

I just learned yesterday that it's the name. So fitting.	I don't have much personal experience with or knowledge about Arab men. When I was in high school, there was an Arab family that lived in the condo above us and many times we heard the father and brother abusing the mother and sister. Like banging their head against the floor (the mom came to our door a few times and told us). We called the cops all the time, but it went on until they moved out and the sister dropped out of my high school. So it wasn't a good impression. I like dark hair on men so I find that attractive but I would probably be a little apprehensive of something serious with an Arab man. 	Do you really want support from someone like Trump or someone who voted for Trump?	Some people don't have the option to be happy sober. Either there's a chemical imbalance or past trauma that makes them incapable of feeling good. Just feeling not like shit is what some people aim for. Half the people who use drugs do it to escape or self medicate their mental issues... I wish I could feel good like I did as a youth... But I need meds to feel normal . Many of us don't get the luxury you have of being happy sober.  Just saying your post rubbed me the wrong way. Sound like a silver spooned young gun with no problems in life.

Obviously the sequels and team ups benefit greatly from seeing other movies, but the stories and characters are pretty well contained. For example, the black panther character being in Civil War adds to the plot, but it isn't required that you know all about the black panther, where he came from and what that has to do with anything coming into the film. 

You could honestly watch the First Avengers film without watching the other films and they establish each character and their motivations/personality fairly quickly."	"lol motherfuckers forgot about mark price. Dude was ahead of his time - #1 option as PG

I could imagine if I doubt you exist. I just don't believe you're you. However it's not like I would deny you exist despite the blatant evidence. If you took a picture of yourself, with today's date, and Reddit username on a piece of paper, it'd be hard to deny you exist.

You answered your own question. Brick and mortar stores are still in business because people want to feel and test out the product before buying. They either aren't avid online shoppers or once they get to a store to look at something they just want that instant gratification and don't want to wait for it to be ordered, processed, and shipped. BRU probably would have price matched your Amazon purchase if you had inquired with them about it and showed them the Amazon item. 

I bought a breast pump at Buy Buy Baby, regularly $499, they price matched it to an amazon sale for $309.  Didn't even question, I just showed them the item and verified that it was in stock and they seemed happy for me that I found such a great deal.

I'm guessing those changes affect the voltage potential as the presence of ions at either side of the synaptic gap will cause an increase of voltage potential with an increase in charge, and the gap length will determine a voltage potential at which the charge will jump from one axon to the next over the gap.

So not only is it then not binary, discretizing the synapse properties would lead to potentially a very high number base. For example, if there were even 10 charge states corresponding to 10 gap widths (since gap width and total charge before firing are not linearly independent), that's still a base 10 number instead of a base 2 number.  Even at base 2, 7000 synapses is still a humongous number. Any higher base would be unfathomable, like say base 10, because it's a 7000-digit number.  I don't think it's right to quantify it in divisions of any word size other other 7000 digits isn't really representative at all, because the total neuron state would be all 7000 synapses simultaneously it seems to me."

"You haven't tried because your counter argument for EVERYTHING sums up to ""Hehhh well even in 2018 a literal nazi with enough votes could win therefore literally any change will be ""bad"" or worthless.

""Progressive"" relative term here since adopting something that already exists in 5 out of 7 western democracies should be centrist at best.

Another common recent example:

Progressive argument ""Well let's legalize/decriminalize marijuana because it's not as bad as alcohol that has ~10% addiction rate but the damage done to low income communities is significant enough to warrant a change"". 

Counter conservative straw man: ""Well there's a 5% chance that with enough marijuana eventually somebody will OD or mow down a playground of kids. Do you want more dead children? whats wrong with you?""

You should call him and tell him.	I told you to go right.	"I'm making on average 5k per character per day just doing order hall missions via the app twice a day.  So in 30 days I should be making about 150k per character.  This is basically completing 2 gold missions per character at 200% completion which will give you 750 to 1000 gold plus 1500 for the completion bonus.

Note that this is an average and not guaranteed.  Sometimes you get runs of bad luck where a single character won't get any gold missions for several days as a time... so the more 110s you have the better. I have 8 and typically make 23 to 27k per day.

It takes a couple of weeks to level up all of one characters followers to max epic and gear level. And it can take even longer to get good items with time reduction or completion bonus on them. But once set up the gold rolls in pretty fast.

"Most people call this song ""mi buen amigo"" and it's one of the most iconic chants in our football, all clubs sing this.

"Speaking as someone who also did that I have to tell you It's not your fault. It isn't fair to you that he harbored feelings, never told you, and then cut contact with you when you did find someone else. It sucks being in that position. It's just that emotions and uncertainty messes with us so much especially when it is about someone we care about. It hurts us too to both leave or to stay. But honestly separation was the best thing for either of us after she got a relationship. I was miserable and it hurt like crazy and that was going to affect the friendship regardless.

Had he stayed, emotions could've gotten the best of him and it would've affected your relationship. Maybe it would've been some remarks, some hating, some passive aggressive shit, or maybe he would've made a move regardless or your boyfriend could tell he had feelings for you and you deny it to the point it starts a fight. There's so many things that wouldn't have been good for either of you but it still sucks to lose a close friend.

You can quickly check which team I'm a fan of with my submission history. If I ever saw one of our fans trying to recalculate the 2016 or 2017 classes because of the transfers we got, I'd straight up tell them that's ridiculous. There's a difference in a player's old recruiting ranking vs. what they are now and how the transfer market works compared to regular recruiting.	"Windows (while not a game - the foundation many rest upon) is just as bad. Throughout the years my biggest fear going up resolutions has always been UI readability and it's pretty awful on the eyes, even at 2k.

But windows has DPI scaling you might say? Except it's really, really shitty. Try enabling it and about 50% of your apps will now malfunction (text bigger than the boxes) whilst the other 50% of them will be blurry and stretched. 

So then MS did something great with W10. They allowed us to set custom UI text size (like back in the day but more in-depth). THIS was the best compromise, even if a little shoddy (requiring a log out to see how those changes would look is very non-user-friendly). But with the creators update? Fuck you we're taking out the option again!

Right now the only way to deal with THAT is to either use custom registry entries for every text change, or use ""System Font Size Changer"" a wonderful little tool birthed from Microsofts strange inability to give shits after having given said shits moments before."	You do know the girl who smashed up that ambulance was Scottish right?	Oh boy, grindcore that takes me back. Bree bree oooh breeeeeeee. 	Thanks! I just posted  I one for like 2 minutes and already got loads of messages so deleted it already hahaha. 	"There are stabbings? Yes. Is it a worrisome situation? In the UK maybe, especially considering that they are building a dystopia and using fear to take civil rights away and create a police state bit by bit.  But look at the numbers:

In all the cases the number of murders is way below the one in the US. 


Country| UNODC murder rates (per 100,000 inhabitants)
---|---
China| 0.74
UK| 0.92
Austria | 0.51
US|  4.88


So yes, there are stabbings in many places. It also rains in many places but not in all rains the same and it is not flooding in all of them. You see the difference, no?

They're definitely one of the best price/performance brands out there. I think what originally sold me on them was a video of the k5 working under running water. Truth is though you don't see many professionals using them. Full frame options from other companies are way more tempting once you start looking at photography as a source of income.

Its made worse by the fact that they know where I live and portray themselves to anyone and everyone as loving parents, saying I am welcome back home and how they want to welcome me with open arms and everything I say is blown out of proportion.  


Yeah, thanks.   


I went straight to the council after they threatened me with a kitchen knife and told me to get the fuck out.   


The council put me up in a travelodge and then sent me back home the next day until they found somewhere for me (two months later) would this have happened if I was female? Unlikely.

I still need a great deal of help and can't get anything. Everywhere I go, first question they ask is ""how about friends and family?""

""I explained how state ownership is not socialism by any academic definition, you still insist that it is despite being wrong"" in your opinion, it doesn't make a different opinion wrong, try reading some modern historians rather than looking only at the source material, or look in academic subjects other than philosophy. ""Except academic discourse and jargon is separate from the common use. Stick to academic definitions when talking about academia, makes sense?"" still pretty important if you are approaching it from a political, historical or sociological perspective so yes it should be used. It does matter as it is the correct use in those disciplines, like it or not it is the academic language in those disciplines because they are looking at something completely different to the philosophy of those writers alone. Historians need to know what laymen meant to understand sources and use the terminology as they do. Make sense? Why can't you wrap your head around this? I am a historian, historians have different views, different approaches, a different approach or an evolved topic doesn't mean difference is wrong. Just because Engels wrote with Marx does't mean he agreed with everything he did, his concepts were more diffuse Marx is insanely formulaic (Also i specialise in Russian history i am aware Lenin massively messed with Marx for his own convenience and created a stop gap, probably because Marx's theories don't work in practice). You didn't even know what economic determinism was? Which is Marxist historiography 101. Don't believe me? Try looking at Marxist historians or the historiography of Marx's work (historiography does not mean history of it means the history of historical writing on a given subject).  I am not talking philosophy i am talking history which is what this thread was about. It isn't my opinion it is the reality of my profession. The writers of Marx's time agree on those things yes but we are still trying to work out what collective ownership means in practice, why not state ownership, if the formula doesn't work maybe it's broken? that is what historians do they question these theories and formulas constantly and look at how society adapts and reflects ideas. The philosophical writers were in consensus but humanity had to figure out the pragmatics and logistics which puts them up for debate as far as historians are concerned. 

Geographers will treat an issue very differently to a sociologist. So of course a historian is going to have a different take to an economist, philosopher or politician. I am not saying you don't know Marx, you clearly do, but you don't know the discipline of history I am trying to explain that in the discipline of history and sociology the subject is treated very differently. But of course i don't know my job, and have a different viewpoint so must me wrong? really? What i have said is the view of Marx and socialism in the discipline of history. If you dislike it fine, if you think it should only be used in philosophy fine, or only in history when the formula fits fine. But i can't change my professions approach or viewpoint because it is fundamentally different to your approach. I'm not confused in the slightest. For historians socialism can have absolutely nothing to do with Marx or his buddies. Again you might not like or agree with it, i frequently don't but it is the case. Stop explaining Marx to me and arguing philosophical terms, i get it this is history it is fundamentally different. Philosophy's definition of Marxism does not bind Histories, they might all use the same term, historians don't. Like it or leave it, think it's right or wrong but that what it is for historians. There is our approach do what you will with it. *shrug* It simple you don't like other disciplines approach to Marx that is fine but they are legitimate and they exist. There are many historians that i fundamentally disagree with, their views are still as legitimate as mine. Again you don't have to like it but that is the situation for historians nothing i can or want to do about it. Again, minus my opinion the Marx's formulas don't work in practice, this is just a statement/summery of the professions view. You can argue all you like but it has nothing to do with me. It is ok you think it is wrong but i am telling you that is how Marxism is viewed by Historians. It is a free for all everything in history is.

"You're delusional if you think a monetized video is making the author ""tens of thousands of dollars"".

The real issue is that you can tag something as ""kids"" or ""family friendly"" with basically no restrictions. If I upload a video of me working on my car I can tag it as ""kids"" and there's no restrictions and people that are watching a lot of videos tagged with ""kids"" may start seeing it. The issue is that someone sees a video that clearly isn't kid friendly, then it gets passed around and gets more and more views. Then you start seeing other videos related to that one because it had other tags on the video as well. 

The only real solution is to hide the ""kids"" tag for authors/creators that make specific content but we all know that Youtube doesn't give a flying fuck about that.

"Only this is the fact. The manager NEVER asked them to leave. 

It would be like you sitting down in a restaurant waiting for a guest who said they would meet you in 20 minutes. The waitress comes by and asked for your order.  You say I'm not ready to order because I'm waiting for someone. The waitress walks away, tells the manager, and manager calls the police without ever coming to your table. 

You are patiently waiting for you friend, when two armed officers come to the table and ask you to leave. You question, why? They say because the manager says you have to go. You asked, ""What have I done.?"" 

They say, ""You have to leave because you have not made a purchase.""

You say, ""I'm waiting for a friend.""

They say, ""You still have to leave. Pick up your belongings and leave.""

There are at least five or six other people in the restaurant who have not ordered because they are waiting for a friend, waiting for their spouse to park the car, waiting for a date to get out of the restroom \(any host of reasons\), but you are singled out.  

You find this absurd and you try to reason with the police. They ask you, in the course of the dialogue, to leave three times. You cannot believe you are being treated this way. Then the police handcuff you and place you under arrest because they have asked you three times to leave. 

As you are walking out, the person you were meeting shows up and asks, ""What is going on?""

You try to explain, but the police still usher you out and take you to jail. 

This is similar to what happened to them. The only difference being, they were singled out because they were black and unlike a restaurant, Starbucks has no written policy that says you have to make a purchase in order to sit in their establishment or use their facilities.

Simple network routing.

Seriously i am a historian i know my terms i know what i am referencing, i am referring to economic determinism which is a completely different thing to dialectical history. Your definition of dialectical history is correct but it isn't at all what economic determinism is. Completely different concepts completely different schools of thought. One is not more popular than the other they are completely different things. Two separate branches of Marxist historiography. But Marxist historiography is not the be all and end all. For example look at the construct of genocide, formed in the 1940s by Lemkin. The term did not exist before him, but the term has evolved and adapted as a theory. His parameters for its definition proved unworkable and it has evolved in both meaning and application. Marx does not forever define what socialism is in the same way Lemkin's musings on genocide are not final. Marx is the reason we use the word ""class"" instead of ""rank"" and ""order"" his work does not define everything relating to the word ""class"". Current definitions by sociologists of what makes and individual a different class will be very different from Marx, that does not make them wrong.

Don't be hemmed into defining Marx economically. He was also a philosopher and a historian his work encompassed a hell of a lot more. And i said at least partially socialist economies which even under your definition is true of most governments, no government is purely capitalist, all economies have socialist aspects. Socialism is not purely defined by Marx.

Again there is a lot more to the concept than economics although disappointingly most people seem to get fixated on it completely ignoring the political as social aspects of his work, and the fact that the theories now extend and have evolved beyond his work. Nationalisation of healthcare, rail networks and other services is absolutely a socialist political stance and an economic one. Again economic socialism does not always go hand in hand with political socialism. "	I suppose that's fair.	Anyone can pass a lie detector test with training.

"For those saying ""they're outside your home so there's nothing to worry about"", or ""We still have our privacy in our homes."", you are all forgetting so quickly WHY Edward Snowden is considered a criminal to the US Government. He was one of the first to reveal that the government (namely the CIA) could access your Smart TV, Smart Phone, Kinect, etc. remotely, turn on the device(s), and view you at any time they want. You DON'T have the privacy you believe you do.

The idea purported by Orwell was that you use small increments to get people to accept and adopt more and more invasive actions and they won't complain but if you make larger steps instead, they'll fight back. It was about how to subvert control over a large population. People think this wouldn't work but are also forgetting how the USSR and Nazi Germany had this happen to them successfully.

Looking for some advice on a possible itinerary I was thinking about. I'm thinking, start in the Puerto Montt area, fly to southern Patagonia, then head up to Buenos Aires (maybe stopping at peninsula Valdés on the way?). I don't really know if I want to spend a ton of time in Buenos Aires, or just use it as a place from which to go to Iguazú Falls or Salta/quebrada de Humahuaca.
Some questions -


- Should I/can I base myself in Puerto Montt to see Huilo Huilo or Villarrica or Chiloe? Which of these do you recommend? At the very least it seems the best place to fly out of to get to punta arenas and see torres del paine


- Going from Patagonia up to northern Argentina, how should I travel and where should I stop? I'd really like to go whale watching in the Valdés peninsula but I'm not sure it's worth how much time and money that will cost (expensive, roundabout flights or crazy long bus rides?)


- recommendations about the area around Salta/san Pedro?


- for some of these parks is it necessary to rent a car to actually get from airports/bus stations to the parks and hiking trails?


- am I really missing out on anything awesome by not spending time in cities?

Thanks so much!

&gt;The US seems to focus on who is president, and the system isn't about that. The election system we have and you have allows small groups to elect a representative for their area.

3) It was expected that there would be an initial drop. Facebook numbers are not in yet (the number you see does not count users who are not logged in) so have to wait for that, but again it was not expected to directly reach or exceed the 2017 stats.
4) See above."	"I don't blame people for walking away, I hated the practice too. On a really slow day they make enough to cover their food cost for the month and the labor for the day. I don't know about the other cost but I imagine they cover their rent, labor, and other bills for each store within the first week to week and a half of the month. 

Labor cost are low cause they pay low and don't give raises hardly ever.

"I would ask for IAEA inspectors to seal and inspect all nuclear facilities in exchange for food and fuel. In return I would agree to a sit down with North Korea.

The way Trump is getting played by a terrible dictator is dumb and very Trump, he's flailing around trying to do everything he can to appease an awful person while the same time attacks US citizens for expressing themselves. You just can just see how much he wants to be liked by KJU, would be hilarious if this wasn't the same person who kills and kidnaps US citizens and threatens nuclear war.

My wife and my sister (2 different people) were both adopted without family history . They all do fine. While parental medical history can help it is not completely necessary.	"Usually it's when there is a hazard, telephone pole, rock, ditch, that your mind decides is so dangerous that your mind freezes on it and you lose awareness of the road or your path on the road. You instinctually ride straight into the hazard as it is all you see, it becomes your only point of reference. 

This normally happens with newer riders that are making conscious decisions as riding has not developed into muscle memory. Like when to turn into  corner to follow a proper riding line. Make a decision a little early or late, are you going to fast, what gear are you in. Anything to elevate your stress level and expose your fear response.

A experienced rider recognizes hazards, but through self discipline keeps looking where they want to go while being aware of hazards but avoiding focusing on them. Maintaining situational awareness you do what it takes to stay on your riding line"	Congrats you found the joke!! Now, if you only had the sense of humor to recognize it. 	Came here to post this only to find it's already the top voted comment. This is a good sub.	Monopoly is probably the game I've played the most without ever actually finishing a playthrough. 	This arises I think because a lot of times they genuinely don't know what late game scaling champs are etc. They play a champion because it looks cool and OP but they actually have no idea about how to play the champion. In the other cases, people just don't want to put the effort into winning, they're playing ranked however ranked has become the same to normals to them and they couldn't care less win or lose LP.

Yes I really like Roserade, honestly one of my favorites and very useful in-game. As you can also see, I used to really love Pidgeot, but after HeartGold I realized how much it sucked and stopped using it. I guess I've used Ampharos a lot too, it's just a very solid Pokemon of a very solid type.

Also I only used Feraligatr on my Silver version because I was 7 and didn't figure out how to catch other Pokemon until about, oh idk, 3 months after beating the game. I was a pretty dumb kid lmao.

As far as I know, some people prefer to use core thief instead of daredevil (the HoT specialisation) because core Sword+dagger thief has better teamfight potential than the dagger+pistol daredevil.

Do you have any plans on buying Heart of Thorns?

It seems to me that you are mostly focused on PvP and WvW. If that is the case then go and play PvP with any class you want untill you find something that you really like. Then you can decide if you want to use the boost or not and if you want to level your thief or if you prefer to play some other class. You have nothing to lose.

Finally in another post you said:
&gt; i dont want to learn the thief and get used to its abilities if im going to quit it at 80 anyway. I feel no need to farm and get hearts anymore if i anyway quit the thief. I am learning the thief and getting used to its abilities which will bother me when i start a new character.

Leveling a thief is great for 1 thing: you have to learn to dodge, because the thief is the less forgiving class in that regard.

Since you want to pvp and be competitive I would suggest you keep leveling your thief and practice dodging, get used to it and make it a habit to dodge when needed. Train your muscle memory so that dont have to think to dodge, but you do it out of reflex. 

Getting used to thief will not bother you when you start a new character. If you know how to play a thief then it means you know how to kill a thief and you know how a thief can kill you. This will help a lot if you want to be good in PvP.

Also if you die the proprietorship dies with you. If you want to give your business to your children, it would need to become a partnership or a corporation.

But I was like ""I got a question for you though, you're Vince Staples right?"" and he said yeah and oh boy I haven't fanboyed out in a minute and I was wilding, told him I fucking loved BFT and Summertime 06 and he's one of my favorite rappers and I'm a huge fan all that shit. My man thanked me and pulled me closer ""So if I get the chicken tenders, how long will it take?"" I told him like 5-8 mins. I was shaking throughout the entire transaction holy fuck im still shaking. Don't remember what drinks he got but pretty sure it was two icees and I remember saying ""you sure not sprite?"" and he laughed.

My dude asks me then ""How are the previews tho? I'm seeing incredibles 2 and I'm not trynna fuck around and miss the previews."" I told him that the movie just came out today and I haven't seen it yet either so I have no clue but it's Disney so they're gonna be fire. He told me he wanted the nachos then and ""a shit ton of jalapeños"" and you already know I grabbed him like 7 containers of them and gave them to him and he was like ""I appreciate it man thanks."" I also told him that I've seen him live a lot including in 2015 when he opened for Earl at the observatory and he was like ""damn you were there? that show was shit, I was shit, Earl was shit."" and I was like ""yeah a fight broke out at the end."" and he was like ""yeah man I remember that shit."" my dude left and I thanked him and said I was a huge fan and legit all my friends there didn't believe me but luckily my homie working door described him the same as I did so I think one of my friends still working is gonna go and say hi to him when it's over.

Fights dont have rules, fights are not always 1 on 1, fights sometimes have weapons involved. Have you ever squared up against a guy only to have his friend/friends sucker punch you from the side? Have you been hit with an object: bat, pool cue, chair, have a beer bottle thrown at you, etc? Have you ever had a guy try to bounce your head off the corner of a table? Has a guy you wanted to fight ever pull a knife or gun on you? Has a guy you were fighting drop you on the ground then try to stomp on your head or soccer kick you in the ribs? These are things that can happen in fights because there are no rules in fights.

However tough you think you are, you are no match for multiple attackers, or against weapons.

&amp;nbsp;

That is why I think you are juvenile. If youve ever been in a fight with someone who truly wanted to fight and not just an escalated verbal scuffle with someone with liquid courage, you wouldnt like the erratic, unpredictable, no rules aspect of fighting."	to be honest I didn't understand any of what that guy said.

"Because of the huge diversity of video games, this could be a problem with rpgs that have a long build up and similarly with action adventure titles.

 It started 2 years ago, the relationship between us (mother of my daughter and i) was pretty much a crutch for both of us, we both needed someone to lean on. I was in a bad place drowning my sorrows in alcohol almost daily and she had just come out of a bad relationship. It was pretty much sex drugs and rock n roll for 3 months, after which we ended up pregnant. The relationship was a farce from the beginning, we only stayed together for the baby (recipe for disaster) Fast forward a year, she goes on a spontaneous trip into the city for a week with next to no notice. I feel somethings amiss with the whole situation and decide to snoop through her phone the night of her return. Suspicions confirmed, she cheated while in the city, which is a deal breaker in my book but not the biggest problem. Along with the unfaithful messages i found, was some really gut retching messages to her friend about our 5 month old daughter. She had confessed to hating our child, wishing she was dead and actually threatened to kill her in these messages. I ended the relationship, and put as much distance between us and her as possible. After alot of arguing i agreed to legally supervised visitation only but she put exactly zero effort in to actually visit. So by the end, nealry 2 years after separation I said i no longer wanted her to be in my childs life and cut contact. Am i an asshole for cutting a parent out of a childs life?"

 Every book must have protagonists, because nobody will care  if some random new character saves the world, it has to be someone you care  about, someone you saw growing throughout the series.

This characters also have to go trough adverseties to the story, not only to grow but to create tension in the middle part of the story and make it interesting.

EDIT: spelling a word"	"There was a talk given in an university union,  organised by the christian society by a pastor about the evidence of Christianity. More specifically about his claim that the narrative of the gospels to be historical. There were about 30 people for the talk. Most of them are self-proclaimed Christians. We were split up in group of 3, 4 or 5 people around a table.  I was with two people. 

He gave a talk to the public, suggesting that the gospel claims to be eye-witness account, he based his argument on John 1:6-9. According to him, because the gospels claim as eye-witness account, therefore the narrative of the gospels are therefore historically true.  That's it, that's the only evidence he literally gave.

  Then we were told to discuss with the group i was in about the topic. I told straight to my group that his argument is bollocks.  The two people in my group tried to justify miserably,  claiming that writing at that time such Josephus, or there were people back them  that talked about it. I responded that Josephus writing on Jesus is a forgery, that there were no external contemporary writings that agree on the historical claim of the gospels. At the end of the event, one of the guy called the pastor to debate against me. Briefly, I said to him that huge miracle, supernatural claims require huge evidences. He asked me what would make me believe about the historical claim of the bible according to him.  I answered to him there should be many no-biblical, contemporary, consistent writings that  agree with the gospels. We agreed to debate tomorrow with back-up evidences.

 Unlike the pastor, English is not my first language, i am not good at communicating.  I wished to say out loud to the public that his ""evidence"" is bullcrap, I didn't have guts to do it. Can you guys advise me how to debate, can you maybe provide unbiased, true scholar, historian researches o the bible.

1. Will you only accept something as truth if it is tested and researched by scientists to the point that it is 'proven'?

If it happens, then it is a truth, for now. Until more is discovered or a breakthrough happens.

1. What is your definition of truth so that you can believe something?

If its a truth, related to science or the world, it requires no belief, it requires proof. If it has proof, then its a truth ""for now""

1. Have you ever had a 'spiritual' experience?

  As a kid a feeling of having to do good for a few days

1. If so, do you talk down your own 'spiritual' experiences as a trick of the mind or something similar?

yes, a mixture of the Catholic religion I was being taught and endorphins from doing good for my parents. And as a kid, not a reliable experience, much like seeing ghosts under the bed.

1. Do you believe in any form of 'psyche-power' (telekinesis, remote viewing, lucid dreaming, astral projection etc).

Unless totally, beyond any shadow of doubt, proven and explained, no

1. Do you know the origins of religion?

To a certain extent, I know about archetypes, ancestor worship, the origins of certain religions, their myths and legends, their changes, syncretism, rituals, some of the logic and dogma of Christianity, and a certain knowledge of other faiths.

1. Do you hate religion? Please explain your answer.

I dont hate religion per se, I hate fanaticism. I dislike how something unproven can tear families, friends, countries, progress and the living of ones life and love.

1. Do you practice meditation? If no, why?

No, because Im not interested. I would give it a try as long as I was explained why to do any certain thing.

1. What do you understand about the power of 'the placebo effect'?

From what little I know, it could be useful for small things, like relaxing a person,or for confidence, but not for any of the worst ailments. Also, prove it works.

1. Do you think it's wrong for somebody to follow a certain way of life that is helping them to be happy but that you do not believe in?

Only if it makes them attack their own well-being, or of others, or the personal lives and well-being of others, their thoughts, their emotions, their love. As long as its private to each person and it harms none and its in accordance with the basic tenets of law, decency,consent and dignity, do whatever you like.

I like Muskoka Lager	"Months before the expansion we already know the last boss in the first tier, the lore and basically everything we will do the next 3-6 months is already out there. Anyone that reads mmo-champion or basic game updates know this and its ruining the excitement and the feeling of something new as its already old before the launch has happend. 

I get the idea of sharing class updates as players have to respond to developers and give feedback based on their preferences, but i feel like a lot of this could be avoided. 

I've personally participated in beta &amp; alpha for the three last expansions and yes i would prefer not to, but i'd like to help blizzard's developers fix issues regarding the game so its a better expirience for everyone at launch. This is something that has to be done and i agree, beta testing is urgent for any game so it doesnt feel unpolished. 

Now, what could we do to resolve issues like this? I'd recommend a electronic Non-Disclosure Agreement, commenly called NDA for players, news sources such as mmo-champion/wowhead/content creators that participate in Alpha/Beta versions of a upcoming expansion. 

However this will limit the numbers of players that Blizzard can invite to beta test, or else it would be a hate train as players that participate in Alpha/Beta will be more prepared for the new content. I'd prefer if players in the high end raiding, mythic+ and all sorts of different activities was granted access as it would cover most areas where bugs could appear. 

For the players here that love/loved vanilla, you'd know the main reason vanilla was so fun (a part from being a more socially constructed expansion) was because you didn't know anything about the content you were about to jump into and feeling there was more corners to explore. 

That feeling is currently gone and has been the past 4-5 years.

The Calculus for gst removal is more than the revenue impact though. Gst is poison and will always be associated with excessive spending. A lot of growth for a developing country is generated by direct investment, perhaps more popular faith in the government will stabilize the country and induce investment? 

Furthermore i think it doesnt make sense to appeal to authority when demeaning angelix by stating that lhl knows more about gst. Lhl might know more, but he also has a vested interest in proclaiming the goodness of gst. It doesnt necessarily follow that he is being objective about it. "	BLOCK PARTY Y'ALL !!!

The high is not nearly as good as other forms of consumption, its a light version of the actual thing.

Luckily I found a reliable and safe plug but when I first started getting into them the cartridges I would find would give me headaches, dizziness, and mini eye seizures after a month or two of vaping those cartridges going on in the streets.

its convenient, no mess involved or annoying smell to hide but you gotta be smart about what youre vaping.

786 BE - gods arrive to Tyria and bring humans with them

1 BE - gods give magic to tyrian races

Even if we pretend to take your quoted article into consideration, gods couldn't create magic, because gods are made of magic and they travel through mists using magic and mists themselves are made of magic. So... no, gods didn't create magic.

I don't really understand the people who don't want to see if he can develop as a qb first but I guess they're mostly making note of obvious similarities between him and other guys who have already either flamed out or transitioned to receiver .

And sociopaths are few and far between. I’ve had cats that lived to 15 before simply getting sick and passing away and I’ve had 1 cat not come home (but he also liked playing with poisonous snakes). I mean there’s every chance they’ll get hurt for sure, I’ve had cats that would get in fights with other cats in the street but it’s no where near as likely as you’d think.

And yes they’re collared, de-sexed and chipped and I can honestly say in my 22 years of life growing up around cats I have never once ever had to pick one up from the shelter because most people know cats are smart and know their around, I have had to pick up dogs from shelters before when they got out and I’ve never had to pay a fee so no idea what that’s about.

All I’m saying is don’t be so quick to imply negligence, cats appreciate the freedom and sure there’s risks but they’re rare and it can be years before something that comes up that actually requires a Vet visit.

First YouTube is highly profitable and the company that owns it is now Google if you live under a rock.. they have more money to burn than the 3rd richest company in the world with 527 BILLION dollars. They don’t need to make sense and they surely don’t need the advertisers but it helps offset their own costs and if someone else would pay you to play ads on shit you don’t even REALLY own they are essentially making you free content in which they didn’t pay production cost on. I honestly see it as their way to do what Amazon and Netflix are doing hence YouTube Red (which they I believe actually pitch in for) after the the ownership.

"First off, let’s all be clear that I personally think your fiancée is overreacting to a certain degree; however, I can and do empathize with where she’s coming from. You lied by omission by intentionally withholding your past history with your friend when you were asked a direct question. I strongly agree with the belief that what’s in the past is in the past and it’s irrelevant to your present relationship. Personally, I wouldn’t have answered the question at all and have told my current SO that I don’t want to know about his previous sexual encounters and he doesn’t have a right to know about mine (we are both STI free and have no children so any exceptions that I would see as valid don’t apply).

But you did answer the question, and you answered with four truths and a convenient omission. 

And, quite frankly, I don’t feel particularly sorry for you. In your original post, you said:

&gt; Something similar happened previously where I didn't tell the truth about something that happened I a previous relationship and she asked me again and I told her the truth.

"&gt; That’s true, but contract law in most counties is largely anarchical. I can agree to sell you my rubber duck for the price of 50 push ups. In almost every country that’s a fair contract. National law only tends to interfere in contracts where the terms are inherently unfair (e.g. anti-slavery law, where I can’t agree to work for you for free in perpetuity). So the general international principle is that people should be able to agree what they want, so long as the terms of the agreement aren’t horrendously unfair to one party or another
&gt; 

I'm with you on that.

&gt; That being said, termination on the basis of health and safety is certainly something that could be deemed “unfair” if not allowed in a contract, but that will depend on the law and is not a certainty. So in Portugal it’s possible that it depends on the contract, but it’s also possible that there’s a law which mandates the option of termination on the basis of health and safety considerations. But would a bull fighter be able to terminate his contract on the basis of health and safety? Or a military pilot? If not, then you have to ask yourself if such a law would exist...

But not here. Workers rights are equal all across the country. Or citizen rights. And those are not dependent on a contract.

More evidence of a corrupt Puerto Rico, from 2018:


&gt; The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has suspended three employees without pay as it investigates 25 cases of possible bribery that occurred in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

&gt; A spokesperson for the power authority — known as PREPA or AEE — told NewsHour that all of the cases involve field employees responsible for restoring power. The employees under investigation are accused of requesting money in exchange for energizing houses or businesses. More than 500,000 of the island’s 1.5 million energy subscribers lack power nearly four months after Maria hit, and PREPA is the territory’s sole electricity provider.

&gt; El Vocero, a San Juan-based newspaper, wrote that the employees under investigation for bribery had requested as much as $5,000 to reconnect power. PREPA declined to provide specific details about the cases, given the ongoing nature of the probes, but the authority is encouraging witnesses to come forward when incidents occur. Anyone found complicit in bribery will face criminal charges, a PREPA spokesperson said.

"IMO integration is key, and all I care about when it comes to immigration.

To be fair, they already spoke English on the most part, but they made efforts to pick up local dialect and slang. 

Now look at modern immigration from the middle east. They live in ghetto badlands where they sex traffic young girls, open shops then sell foreign food, open their own and mosques and their own schools.

"Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to answer questions. I don’t use twitch so I’m hoping you’ll see my question here. 

My fiancé is a fairly hardcore gamer. He gets a lot of satisfaction from achievement hunting and accomplishing things in games. He thinks I hate it and am against it, but I’m not at all - he’s adorable when he’s excited about things in the game, and it’s probably the only time I see him care about anything. 

We’ve recently had a major issue in our relationship - I found out he had cheated on me, with the same person, off and on for around two years. I’m hopeful we can work through it, though I know it will be a long process and I’m trying really hard to deal with my own feelings of anger and resentment. It might sound insane that I even want to try and work on things, but we have two kids and a whole life together. 

He’s having a very hard time coming to terms with what he’s done. He is so disgusted with himself he has shut down, and currently he’s been signed off work for two months with depression and anxiety. He feels agoraphobic, he won’t even take our children to the park or take a walk with us. He’s angry with me all the time, incredibly defensive even (especially!) when it’s related to something he’s assumed or misunderstood, and I’m reaching breaking point. 

I feel like I’ve tried so hard and he’s just not meeting me half way anymore. When I first found out, the following few days were like watching him grow up - he took responsibility, he was remorseful and caring and patient with me, and he committed to working on our relationship. 

I don’t blame myself for his affair, though I understand why it happened - I had just had our first child, who was three months premature, and I had PPD so wasn’t interested physically. He was offered sex on a plate and didn’t think he’d get caught. He’s an idiot, and there’s no excuse for what he’s done, but that’s the base reason. 

How can I help him with his anxiety and depression? He refuses to seek out counselling, and says he’s a broken sociopath (his exact description) and he’d just lie to whoever he spoke to anyway. And how can we work on our relationship? He claims to want to, but doesn’t seem willing to actually DO anything. 

Is it time for me to realise he’s not interested in me or our relationship? He says he loves me, but he’s not showing it, at a time where I really need to see it. But while I know if I left him he would still be a huge part of our kids lives, I think he would fall apart. I run his life for him, he doesn’t even eat unless I put food in front of him. I make his appointments and wash his clothes and remind him when he needs to shower - if he didn’t have me, I don’t know what would happen to him. Maybe I’m enabling his depression and refusal to do anything that might help him. But he has suicidal thoughts, and a recent increase in his antidepressant doesn’t seem to have done anything. 

Appreciate any advice or help you can provide. We’re based in the UK. I’m aware I’m an absolute sucker who should have kicked him out when I found out what he’d done, but I didn’t. But I’m on the verge of leaving because nothing else has worked. "	I used to listen to ppv’s that way. Jim Ross was so good at announcing that it worked really well even when I only got the audio.

"Interesting how everyone talks about the partisan judges now.

I always believed nominating a judge was an easy endeavour. 

Kav complained about the politisation of the court. Ben Sasse made a better, and more rational statement to this during the hearings.

Yet, I can’t help but believe this is a Republican creation. And I think the reasons for that are:

- citizens united type rulings
- Rep judge may be better for big business rulings
- anti gay marriage
- anti social rights progress
- anti abortion


My point is that the Republicans seem to have an agenda with their nominations. 

While a Democrat is just nominating a good judge. Surely, the Dems may have a strategy with their nominations, but it doesn’t feel as specific as the Republicans.

I hardly ever hear democratic campaigning on “ we need to win the courts”. We hear it constantly from republicans.

Judges are impartial, follow precedent, and make rational decisions. Or they should. 

Anthony Kennedy was a Republican nomination, and he voted for gay marriage because of changing times and social acceptance. That is, a judge can change their mind with the evolution of society. 

It scares me to think of the reasons why stacking the court is so important to the R’s. 

"	"Folks, there is actual medical research about the benefits vitamin d and immune function. I started taking it because my doctor told me to.

I’ve spoken to her about this topic a lot over the years, and I’m communicating what she told me.

- most people do not get enough vitamin d in the winter

- vitamin d is very beneficial to your immune system

- there are virtually no risks to taking small amounts (&lt;5000 UI/day) of vitamin d

She has outright told me that everyone in the northeast, where I am located, ought to take vitamin d fall through spring (and in the summer if they don’t get outside regularly). It works wonders for your immune system, it often alleviates seasonal depression, and it’s important for bone health.

Back in 2008 (when the price dropped from an average of around $4 per gallon to around $1.60 per gallon) Saudi Arabia flooded the market with tons of oil.  They massively increased production despite the fact that demand had not increased.  Why?  To hurt Iran, who also relies a lot on oil sales, and is their biggest rival in the region.

&gt;In November 2006, Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi security consultant connected to Prince Turki al-Faisal, then Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Washington, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post noting that if “[i]f Saudi Arabia boosted production and cut the price of oil in half … it would be devastating to Iran … [and] limit Tehran’s ability to continue funneling hundreds of millions each year to Shiite militias in Iraq and elsewhere.” Two years later, at the height of the global financial crisis, the Saudis acted: They flooded the market, and within six months, oil prices had fallen from their record high of $147 per barrel to just $33. Thus, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began 2009, an election year, struggling with the sudden collapse in government oil revenues and forced to slash popular subsidies and social programs. The election’s contested outcome was accompanied by economic contraction and the worst political violence in Iran since the fall of the shah.

Basically, Vecna was a powerful - and evil - liche whise corpse wound up being cut up and spread all over the world. If found, and if a character were to put the body part where it would replace a missing corresponding body part of his own body, the body part would instantly meld - irrevocably - into place on the character, and function as if it were the character’s own all along. The body part would also impart some of Vecna’s magical powers onto that character. 

But since Vecna was evil, the body part was cursed, and would saddle the character with some hideous results. It would also make the character’s alignment skew more toward the evil side of the spectrum.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

I suffer from a serious mental health issue that makes me extremely prone to violent break downs. My mom, step-dad, and fiancé are the only people that know about a personal secret of mine. I established multiple times with my mom that I need her to keep it private. She agreed and that’s where we left it.

The 4th of July comes around last year and my family always goes to a neighborhood parade. While at the parade, my mom and I were sitting with my family chatting when she accidentally lets some of the secret slip. She realizes it and stops talking. I could feel a meltdown coming on so I told everyone that I needed to go to the bathroom and booked it to my grandma’s house. I thought I’d just need a few minutes to cool off but the edge just wouldn’t go away, so I decided to let my mom know I was going to leave so I could cool off at home and I might join them later for fireworks. 

She texts “get down here in 5 minutes or less or I’ll tell everyone”. That was it. That triggered the meltdown full force. So I run back down to my family trying to hold back a flood of emotions and I tell them I had something come up and I had to leave. They were understanding because my mom had disclosed my mental health issues with them (without my permission). 

My mom gets even angrier and tells me I have to stay. I start walking away and she grabs onto my arm. Bam, full meltdown in front of everyone. I dramatically fall to the ground sobbing about my life falling apart, and I felt like the whole world was collapsing in on me. Then my mom starts getting all “sweet” and “supportive” and tries hugging me. I get up and walk away without acknowledging her. 

I get to my car and I get a text from my mom with a list of people saying “here’s a list, in order, of everyone I’m going to tell if you don’t snap out of it by tonight”. Note that I’m not directly quoting bc the texts are really old, I’ll try to find them and post them in the comments. 

Anyways, I go off on her saying really nasty things. I told her she’s an awful cunt for trying to blackmail me, and of course some other colorful things. She texts me back that I’m personally attacking her like usual and that she did nothing wrong. She said that she was upset that I tried to leave the parade bc she didn’t want my family to press her about why I left. She cancelled my graduation trip because of this situation. 

I’ll admit that I have a long history of being awful to people that stems from my disorder. I can normally tell afterwards whether or not I was in the wrong but I really can’t with this one. I just want some clarity, was I the asshole in this situation?

The equivalent example in humans is (funnily enough)...bald guys. 
 
There is zero evolutionary reason for a man to go bald. 

But what probably happens is that a bald man works harder and is more successful to counterbalance his “handicap”, and he is therefore more fit. This is true for peacocks. If you can survive with your handicap, you’re EXTRA fit, bro!

Same for dyslexic men and men that are psychopaths. They tend to end up being a disproportionate # of CEOs of companies as a result of their developing very strong social skills to deal with their handicaps. 

Also back to the balding point, the testosterone that causes male baldness is higher for men that lift weights. So getting buff may make you bald, but as we all know, it’s also increasing your sexual fitness.

Even if her lines or accent annoyed you (I was fine with it all) she had more depth as a character in her own right.

And believable, people go nuts in relationships.

Bronn is more fleshed out in the show, as is OSha and as is Margery. Margery in particular is a scene stealer.

Also I liked Ros very much...think the actress was good and it was a great perspective on the ground and humanizing to the small folk in a way we don’t get as much of in the books, at least regarding the whores who are ever present. We get Alayala but never her perspective or immediate experiences like we did with Ros. Lots of little moments with her that I think helped flesh out the story/world."

•I chose the pieces because firstly I have the both stuck in my head for days now and I want more people to know about how amazing this video is. First the animation, I can’t really tell how much I like(there’s a video by a YouTube online that made a really in depth and super cool video about the film) I just really like the settings and how lively the characters are. The music in it is what I enjoy most, once again I can’t really put into words how much I like it but it’s the perfect song to go with the short and the instruments that go in and out in their own little segments sound so good.

It’s a lack of belief.

Think of it like three options. One side has a belief there is a god. The middle is a lack of a belief in a god. The other side is a belief there is no god.

Option 1 and 3 are convictions. Beliefs. The middle option is not a conviction. It is merely the lack of a belief.

That is atheism.

specificity there is gnostic atheism. Atheists who do believe there is no god. 
But atheism base is just the lack of belief in the direction of gods. Not the belief In the opposite. Then they go farther to say there is none. "	"I agree with you on a lot of those points!

"As a die-hard Sens fan, I’ve always been hopeful for Hogberg, and I’ve watched him in every development camp in Ottawa since he was drafted, but he is still a giant question mark. His numbers from his 3 seasons in the SHL were .917, .911, and .931. That’s an average season, a below-average season, and one very good season.

His ECHL play was slightly above average but not dominant: .920 save but with over a 3 GAA at the same time, and ECHL numbers are meaningless when discussing NHL potential success.

His only meaningful play has been in Belleville, which has been ugly. When he was brought over at the end of last year he went winless in 3 games, and this year he has 2 wins in 6 games, admittedly on a rough Belleville team. Unfortunately, Belleville is a mess right now, but Hogberg is a part of that. Hogberg still needs to prove he can adapt to the smaller ice and grittier game, which he hasn’t yet done at all.

I’m hopeful that a Hogberg will adapt quickly, but let’s be real though: Hogberg has never been anywhere close to the same skill level as Chabot, not at any level, in any league. They’re not just miles apart, they’re light years apart.

&gt;Khabib Nurmagomedov doesn’t sound fired up. He doesn’t sound bothered, actually.

&gt;Just hours after Conor McGregor and his friends stormed a bus carrying Nurmagomedov and other fighters competing on Saturday’s UFC 223 card in the Barclays Center loading dock, Nurmagomedov said he wasn’t impressed by Team McGregor’s antics.

&gt;""I am laughing inside,” Nurmagomedov said. “You broke window? Why? Come inside. You know UFC don’t let you come inside. If you real gangster why don’t you come inside?

&gt;""This is big history gangster place. Brooklyn. You want to talk to me? Send me location. We have to talk? I am gonna come, no problem.

&gt;""I grew up like this. I don’t grow up throwing chairs at window. This is not my bus.”

&gt;Following Thursday’s media day at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., McGregor, as well as members of his team, entered the arena. According to sources with knowledge of the situation, they arrived in “retaliation” against Nurmagomedov and his team cornering Artem Lobov, a teammate and good friend of McGregor’s, earlier in the week. Bad blood has been brewing for months between both camps.

2. I wasn’t a tanker while in the Army, but I was an Explosive Ordnance Disposal tech, meaning you have intimate knowledge of the types of munitions employed by the military, and how explosives work.
3. Tanks rarely, if ever, employ munitions designed to do anything other than kill other tanks. Tank rounds are almost exclusively Armor Piercing. On the rare chance a tank would use an Anti-Personnel round, it would be in the form of grapeshot.
Yes, the force of the explosion, in the form of a compressed wave of air (essentially a sonic boom) is what does the most damage to a human, however all anti-personnel munitions are designed with fragmentation, to maximize effect on human targets.
4. As for killing zombies, tanks *are* useless, but that’s more because tanks are meant to be tank-killers. Best way to take out zombies with current military weapons, is honestly just evacuate the area, then carpet bomb and let the bodies burn. No need to put a bunch of humans at risk trying to shoot each zombie in the head.

Of course I had to [make a blog post about it](http://www.clondon.me/blog/28hoursinmunich).

Unrelated story time: Someone posted in a local fb group looking for a female professional photographer. Myself along with several others popped our portfolios on the thread.  A couple minutes later, I got a message asking for “a few photos in only my underwear,” and to “come alone.” 

Going with my gut on that one I replied to him in a very cordial way that it is not the type of work I do, but I wish him luck finding someone. 

He then proceeded to write this ranting comment on the original thread about how he’ll just do it in Ukraine where “lady photographers are more open” and how the rest of us are “prejudice towards men.” Because apparently professional women not wanting to take photos of some dude in his tighty whities means we’re prejudiced. k, bro."

I’m sorry you haven’t heard from your half brother. When I messaged my biological father’s daughter she deleted her Ancestry profile, but thankfully used her real name so I could still find him (I initially thought I was the product of a known affair my mother had.) I’ve matched to two donor conceived half siblings since finding out and it’s gone much better with them. One already knew and one didn’t know, but has been open to a relationship.

One of my favorite examples of what I’m talking about is in the Netherlands.  The cities of Delft and Rotterdam are about 30 minutes apart and are both university cities.  But Delft has a beautiful old school canal look with small narrow houses and new dense construction is restricted. It’s super desirable since the housing is rare and most people live outside of the city center because it’s super expensive.

But Rotterdam? Rotterdam was firebombed by the Nazis in WW2, so there is no “old city” to preserve. It was all rebuilt with dense buildings and the city is very liberal about tearing down old things to put in new. As a result, it’s ultramodern and very inexpensive to rent an apartment compared to Delft."	Aww that’s sweet.

There are a finite number of software engineers in the world, and a smaller number of talented ones. All these engineers go to wherever the hot workplace is, and that company does the best in the industry while that company is hot. After a while (historically), they start to leave for greener pastures, and the company starts to do more poorly - the company starts to have to backfill with worse engineers.  The big hot companies were MS in the 90s, then google, then apple, and now amazon.  I’m sure there were more, but those were the big shakers.

It’d also help keep Gabe’s costs down, since some key talent will be paid for by WWE. Evolve just needs to pick a single region where they have four solid venues to run (500-800 capacity or so) and run those monthly-ish like WWE does at Full Sail, only one venue each week. Then they can build a regular following, while running spot shows around them. There’d be enough work to keep everyone happy, and the booking would be stabilized.

If using the same fanless design with 5w chips, it also would be neglibly heavier, maybe 2.2lbs instead of 2lbs for the 12”.

The people you cannot find a way to empathise with (who might also find it difficult to empathise with you) have clearly walked a different path in life, leading to different ideas and solutions. 

They are not evil, and the moment you content yourself to the idea you cannot see them in any way but an *enemy* you begin to tread the worn path that lead to the worlds greatest atrocities. The moment you start thinking it is impossible to get through to people, you should find yourself terrified at the implications. Because if it’s “us or them” then the only outcome that is guaranteed *is* tragic. 

At worst, assume your disagreements arise purely because others are uneducated, but don’t discount the idea that there is critical information that you are missing too. Nobody expects you to ever be persuaded that it’s ok that you and your loved ones are threatened, but is it possible for you to imagine that for some reason the people threatening you feel just as threatened *by* you? 

It’s hard. But the final thing I find helpful is to really focus on listening. When you feel that knee jerk or sigh because you’ve “heard it all before,” stop yourself. Try to take your own emotional response out of it. Assume you’ve misheard or misunderstood and listen. Instead of simply replying with your opinion or outright ignoring them, try to stand in their shoes, given just what you’ve heard, and ask an honest question relevant to your own view that you feel isn’t adequately answered. It’s got to be genuine, though, or it won’t work. This way you can work someone towards your own concerns in their mind. Sometimes they won’t be able to answer a question, and when you reach that point you know you’ve hit somewhere you can start changing someone’s mind.

I would never deny that the Torah is in the Bible, that’s just silly. I’m not speaking to doctrine, applicability or anything theological. I’m only clarifying that it is possible to make a distinction between sections; no more, no less. Your original comment said Christians couldn’t make a distinction between parts of the Bible, which is factually untrue. Just look at any study Bible or ask literally any scholar of biblical literature and they will tell you the (current) Bible is divided into sections. You are acting as if I am saying some sections are more important than others, and if you read my replies I said no such thing.

Edit: I have amended my original comment to avoid confusion."	Says the Lakers fan...oh boi	"If the price of land becomes really high you get more value out of being able to put more units on it.  Cities fight hard to preserve their classic “look and feel” usually prevent that construction with zoning laws which keeps housing scarce. 

Landlords aren’t one unit- they are competing with each other.  Sure, if landlords could all conspire together to jack their prices up that would be ideal for them, but they can’t. Instead, if I’m a landlord, and I can rent one unit out for X, but I could build an eight unit on the same land and rent it for 6X total, why not?


One particular way to influence this behavior is property taxes. A story I’ve always found interesting- in Amsterdam in the 1500’s, the city taxed houses based on their width. The result? Everyone competed to build the thinnest, tallest building, and that gave Amsterdam its unique look.

Similarly, I read that one common strategy is to raise property taxes on areas with multifamily zoning.  If you are a landlord with a property with a single unit that rents for X, that might cut at your profit margin. It makes it more tempting to tear it down and build a, say, 8-plex, or if you don’t have that kind of money, sell it to a developer who will.

The tl;dr is that property taxes encourage land owners to try to maximize the land use. In a world  with no property taxes people would literally “park” on vacant lots waiting for a future good opportunity to sell, for example; with taxes chipping away, they won’t. Similarly, high taxes on multifamily zoning chip away at your profits if you don’t use the land to maximum extent.

So in my mind- theorycrafting- I think expanding multifamily zoning to more parts of the city, then raising property taxes on just the multi family zoned areas, is a decent way to subtly spur people towards developing denser buildings. You could also offer tax breaks to new dense developments optionally."	Just to be 100% clear, you said ‘free speech is fine, unless I think it is over the line’.

Sure but only because of God’s decree.  There isn’t anything special about spilling a lambs blood that removes sin, it’s the obedience to God that removes the sin.

&gt; Can you be more specific about the nature of the proper condition of Adam and Eve Pre-Fall?

Absolutely!  Pre-Fall, humanity existed in a state which we call Original Justice.  Justice being defined as proper order.  Humanity was in right relation with God, between man and women, with creation, and with themselves. 

With the introduction of original sin our first relationship marred was our relationship with God.   We began to focus inwards on ourselves rather than outward on others.  Self-preservation rather than self-gift.  We were forced to hide from God, The relationship between man and women was out of dominance rather than true equality, creation doesn’t respond well to human occupation (examples are like growing food is laborious and evil evident in natural disasters) and within ourselves meaning sinful desires arise from within us.

Through Christ’s ministry, he was able to turn the tables on that reality.  Think of his Golden rules and his healing of natural evils!"

Not really, but my cats are a lot smaller than my American furballs, both in being overweight (only one is) and in general size. But mine are all street cats or random mixes, most of what you see online from Japan are mostly purebreeds. 

The most popular cat here is the Scottish Fold, and since many of them don’t get the “food” gene, and you can’t breed 2 folded cats together healthily, you have a lot of unfolded Fold ears. But the other trademark of the breed is their large, round faces that seem to be really curious and adorable. So likely, most of them are a Fold without the ears, and that leads to it. 

Most cats here, too, are either indoor cats, so rather curious with new things, or outdoor cats that are more like neighborhood cats that get fed by a particular person. So you’re mostly seeing the indoor cats, too. 

Finally, cat owners here are crazy. When you spend hundreds or thousands on getting your cat (and finding apartments that let you have cats is hard as hell. Small dogs, no problem. Cats?

Season One of GoT is a near perfect example of how to adapt a book for television. Unfortunately, as the show gained popularity, D&amp;D took more and more liberties with the source material. After the monumental success of the Red Wedding, GoT effectively stopped being a faithful adaptation of ASOIAF, and by mid Season Five had devolved to its current state of high-budget fan fiction.

None of that is really HBO’s fault. It’s the fault of D&amp;D and the other writers of GoT, who rather than reconciling six faithfully adapted seasons with the inevitable non adapted (due to lack of books) last two; chose to play fast and loose the minute the first season wrapped."

Proud, as in satisfied and celebratory of the ideals, realized or not, set forth by ancestors, without personal involvement. “We the people..., all men are created equal”.  Germans might have this but not mention it for fear of it seeming like celebrating their past.

Proud, as accepting and unashamed of personal circumstances and attributes from birth, “black and proud”.  Especially for disadvantaged people, outsiders. Germans might not have use for this. 

Proud, as satisfied with current ideals, behavior and accomplishments of your community, with your personal involvement. Germans would have this pride for what the nation has become culturally in recent decades and what it is accomplishing.

Kids that young are just slipping into independence. this is entirely hypothetical but I’d say it probably has to do with (if not trauma) a child feeling a sense of learned helplessness.

For me it was a combination of my parents divorce, other kids not liking me (I was a weird kid, I suspect I’m maybe on the autism spectrum), my mother putting all of her emotional trauma from the divorce into me.

I think this is the main part you should accept. Maybe accept the food too.

If your brother is obese and your father’s mother is diabetic it sounds like food may be a problem issue in the family already. 

This is how he shows he cares. It’s probably how he was taught to show he cares.

My grandmother and my husband’s grandmother are convinced we don’t love them if we don’t take them out to eat.
We could buy them a cruise for Xmas ^we ^*dont*  but you have to *take them out to eat* for it to be considered a *gift* or a show of affection in their minds. 

Maybe this is his version of that. It doesn’t make it right. It doesn’t make it healthy. And it doesn’t make him a good father. 

What matters now is what makes you be able to live at peace with him. Be it with no contact, or accepting the food then later throwing it away, or having the full fledged argument and throwing away in front of him.

Personally I would institute a diet change, whether constantly or only in front of family. 
In front of my family i was vegetarian for a number of months for health reasons, simply because they would want to go out to eat so often... I wanted to regulate my personal diet within their constant need to be at a restaurant. 

Know who’s hard to buy fast food for? A vegetarian that’s not eating cheese pizza. Or even more difficult, vegan.
That particular approach *may actually be* the more asshole approach but it theoretically avoids near constant arguing. 

Logic seems to have no place with this particular issue, as it often doesn’t with family.

I will note that a common criticism of rent control is that it provides less incentive for a landlord to maintain a property. I found an anecdotal example of this when I went to Mountain View to report on its recent experience with rent control: http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-local-rent-control-battle-20180926-story.html

Martin Cortez, 50, a San Mateo County psychiatric social worker, credits rent control with helping him stay where he has lived for more than a decade: a small, two-bedroom apartment he shares with his girlfriend and 22-year-old daughter who has severe autism. He pays $2,086 a month. Before the measure passed, he had been threatened with eviction and large rent hikes.

“It felt like the floor was being taken out from under you,” Cortez said. “You couldn’t live where you live. You did all the right things. You go to college, you work in the community, and then you couldn’t afford the crummiest of places anymore.”

Still, Cortez said he has noticed some changes since rent control has gone into effect. His previous landlord sold the complex, and Cortez said the new owners don’t maintain it. A plugged sink took weeks to fix, trash piles up and the complex’s washing machine jumps when used, he said. He’s also seen lots of new faces around neighboring apartments, which he believes are Airbnb renters, given the advertisements he’s seen on the site."	where did u do yours! and how was it? i’m still contemplating between extraction and root canal. how old are you?

One was mistaken identity (the car I was in closely matched the description of a vehicle involved in a robbery), the second was due to a black toy gun (that a friend’s kid left in my car) which an officer spotted on the backseat as I was rolling through a DUI checkpoint.

In most departments, a felony stop requires backup, guns drawn, the whole “keys on the roof, walk backwards and kneel on the ground” thing, and then handcuffs while they investigate. 

It sucks.. but in each of those instances, I remained calm, did what I was told to do and how I was told to do it...

Not sure where in history that was.

Even Shlomo Ben Ami said Israel didn’t offer a good deal. They never offered a deal on the ‘67 lines. 

&gt; The left hate Israel because they are strong and successfully, and the Palestinians are seen as the weaker side. The left see the stronger side as the oppressor (thus the made up narative of apartheid and ethnic cleaning) just because they are strong, and the Palestinians as the oppressed because they portray themselves as the underdog.  Pre 1967, the left supported Israel who had lost the West Bank and Gaza in the Arab Israeli war, and were against the Palestinians due to their show of strength. It wasn't until Israel became the stronger side by beating all the Arab armies in 1967 when the left switched sides, as did the Americans.

This a convoluted theory designed to hide the obvious. Israel didn’t lose the West Bank and Gaza. It never belonged to them. The armistice lines never contained the West Bank or Gaza. Yes when Israel illegally conquered them, the left stopped supporting that because imperialism and colonialism aren’t left values. 

&gt; To treat the Israeli Palestinian conflict like a Tom and Jerry cartoon by supporting the mouse, just because he is the underdog, regardless if he is the cause of the trouble, is childish. To insist one side is right and ignore the attrocities they do just because they are the underdog, shows a lack of reasoning and intelligence.

By this point the ball is back with the pitcher and I yell “Safe”.

Thanks! Honestly, it sounded alright for someone who is super seriously into Christianity and spreading the gospel around the world. I’m just fundamentally opposed to that whole idea, so all Christian churches are cults in my view, and converting third worlders to Christianity is wrong on so many levels.

That’s all cool and everything, but I’d love to see humankind reject all of the crazy ancient religions.

Drawing arrows out vertically is far less efficient than drawing them out sideways from a belt-mounted horizontal quiver. A slight angle keeps the arrows from falling out, but gravity ensures the next arrow is always in a predictable position, instead of shifting around in a box or sleeve on your back.

Source: [Lars Andersen](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BEG-ly9tQGk). He’s a nut-job, but it looks like he’s at least moderately right on the quiver thing.

It is morally wrong for the niggers and honkys to fornicate, as god put the niggers in Africa and the honkys in Europe for a reason. It’s like mixing oil and water, niggers and honkys are not compatible. Every ethnic group has a right to a homeland. Polacks in Poland, Dagos in Italy, Drunks in Ireland, Somali niggers in Somalia, beaners in Mexico, Americans (natives) in America, etc. Multicultural countries always have conflicts because the different ethnic groups naturally hate eachother because of human nature (tribalism). Historically, Ethnic groups that are homogenous like the Japs have significantly less infighting than multicultural nations like America. We had a fucking civil war because the niggers and honkys couldn’t get along for fucks sake. Then there is the issue of how the slave trade started- kikes bought slaves from the niggers (they enslaved their own people), and then with their media control blamed the entire thing on the whites (white people absolutely owned slaves and had a part in this, but the kikes were the original buyers). Basically the kikes brought niggers over to America knowing that the honkys and niggers would hate eachother and a civil war would start. Throughout all of this, the Indians were relegated by the kike government to reservations after their land was destroyed by the Honky invaders (this one they actually were guilty of, mostly English and Dutch. However it seems like Polacks, Micks, and dagos are being lumped in with them by the kike media).

The point of this is that racism is human nature, and the virtue signaling PC culture we have isn’t trying to eliminate racism, but it is a distraction pushed on us by (((them))) to brainwash the populace into voting for democrats, keeping the establishment intact and people’s innate racism bottled up until there is a race war.

I think it’s multifactorial, but part of it is that hospitals are struggling to stay afloat as their government reimbursements wane; the only way to keep their heads above water is to charge insurance/patients more. The government penalizes hospitals who have patients that need to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days for conditions like COPD and heart failure, and gives them less money. I think that if we can decrease admissions for preventable diseases, those costs will go down as Medicare funding can cover those who have conditions that can’t be prevented. From there, we could be able transition to a better government funded infrastructure. In a perfect world, this would be fixable in a day by having hospitals agree to slash costs in return for government funding to create universal healthcare, but it’s just not realistic. It’s just escalated so outrageously that I think baby steps like this are the most realistic ones to take. I would be interested in hearing other opinions though!

"I haven’t been on Facebook in a few years. Even back then it appeared very unhealthy. How can you live a life when you are constantly comparing your life to others? Wisdom and maturity can help people see through the BS and recognize that behind the best vacation photos, the best family photos is fighting, angst, stress, and worry. Those are a fundamental part of being human. No one can avoid them. I doubt Fakebook’s positive influence on society. 

My niece is an intelligent and beautiful young girl. However, she has a fascination with being rich. She now has verneers when her teeth were fine to begin with and she dates men in their 40s. She is in her early twenties. She openly admits to looking for a rich Jewish guy. Meanwhile she jumps from guy to guy and they are just using her. I worry that the younger social media generations are going to have prevalent issues with their self worth and self esteem. That they will completely judge themselves by what they have or what they own. Because all they see is the best of their peers lives. 

That is a tough world to live in. Some strange world where you so easily judge and are easily judged. Where your life seems so terrible compared to the perfect life of others.

Life is not a competition, it is a journey. It is unique to each of us and happiness is not in the things we accumulate along the journey but in the experiences and relationships that we found along the way. 

Frugality in my opinion is a way to make that journey a little less stressful, a little more generous, experiences more memorable, relationships a little deeper, and most importantly more meaningful. 

What is the alternative? To be a slave to stuff and competing in a pointless competition that you simply cannot win?

I’ve since found out that she emailed my coworkers to tell them not to send me emails or requests until I’d been back and settled in for a while so i didn’t feel overwhelmed or have to think about anything but my family. Throughout both times she sent me encouraging gifs from her personal cell, and sent me an edible arrangement with these comically enormous balloons.

"First off, I don’t expect corporations to offer political analysis.  It’s great when they do but I don’t consider it an obligation they have.

Secondly...and maybe I’m just being stupid here- but Bezos usually leans left when he’s not directly protecting his stockholders.  If Amazon’s stock price falls enough, people will try to buy him out with a hostile takeover.  I do not want to see Amazon in the hands of someone like the Koch brothers, and I’m pretty sure that is what would happen if Amazon changed hands.  I don’t know if that is even possible, but it’s something I worry about with most of the mega corps.  What happens if someone far less moral takes the reins?

When I boycott I either make sure it’s making a statement but not actually doing damage, or I make sure I’m okay with the alternatives.  Getting people to boycott Amazon would not be a success if everyone shopped at Walmart instead.  And I never want to see someone like Trump owning controlling interest in Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc.  The idea is terrifying.

So Spielberg changed enough that the overall story arc and the soul of the book was still the same, but it was done in a shorter time, and without feeling like anything was missing. That’s a feeling you often get from movie adaptations that follow too closely to the book material, because semi-important bits get cut out due to time constraints. By altering it enough to tell it his way without distancing it too far from the book, we get a work that feels complete, even though it’s much shorter than the original work.	I’ll try and get back about the dialogue. But as for destruction and being intelligent, I agree they are not mutually exclusive when done well. The problem is that the destruction is essentially michael bay. The visuals are so overstimulating that it turned into white noise for me.

I started with one chocolate on my mouth and after the second one we were making out again but A LOT more intense. This time she undressed me and she let me undress her. My mom wasn’t home yet since she went out with a male friend of hers to dinner.  We had sex for a long time on my bed probably for like 2 hours or 3 don’t remember exactly. We were both pretty sweaty and it started to smell kinda weird in my room so I suggested we should take a shower hefore my mom got home and in there she asked me to clean her and we ended uo having sex again for like a little less than an hour in there then after we were all done we came out of the bathroom and sh asked me to carry her to the bed to go to sleep. My mom got home and was in the hallway at the moment we got out of the bathroom. So I was thinking. ‘Fucking fail’ but my mom was cool and just said ‘I brough back some dinner if you guys are hungry hope you two had fun’ and she just left Lol. So we just cuddled and went to sleep agisin and we were just looking at each other and she just blurts out ‘I love you’.

Alright so do you guys think she is really in live with me or is just because we had sex?"

"	"I'm wary about your first paragraph.  We haven't had a lot of success in nation building, and the countries we have done it in haven't looked kindly on us when we try it.

The economics side is tricky and I don't think either side is entirely right.  On one side, having the additional labor does help the economy.  On the other side welfare abuses and the lack of paying income taxes and being paid under the table hurts.  If you were to get rid of all the illegals in California they would be able to get rid of the sales tax and still be revenue neutral.

What I would do is let in more people, legally.  I have no problem with bringing in people as long as it is done legally and they follow all our laws.  They pay taxes, follow our laws and are good people.  If they break our laws, we kick them out so fast their heads will spin.  I also want a background check on them, no violent crimes or felonies in their past.

We stop down hard on illegal immigration.  The separation that is being brought up in the news is the least of the bad shit that can happen.  Women and girls are often given birth control because it is common for the coyotes that smuggle them across to rape them.  If they don't use a coyote and are caught trying to cross in Mexico they can be killed.

Which brings me to the wall.  I don't really care what it looks like to our neighbors.  Like I said before, Mexico has a wall along part of the Guatemalan border, so they don't really have much right to complain about it.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is an up front cost that I think will save money in the end.  It is cheap to maintain and in the areas where it runs will cut down on the number of people needed to patrol in those areas.  It is also a huge deterrent to illegal immigration, which cuts down on the horrors that happen to the people crossing illegally. It will also cut down on the welfare we give to illegals.  It stops the catch and release, stops us from having to separate families.

"This was right after Diaz signed his infamous deal that everyone hated so much.

When negotiating his new contract prior to the title fight, they told Diaz that if he won the title fight, he would be able to immediately renegotiate.

He was very confident that he would beat Ben, so he and his manager hatched a plan to get a large signing bonus in exchange for  a low per-fight pay.  Then they would bank the signing bonus, win the fight, then renegotiate for a higher per-fight deal.


He ended up getting $500k up front and a $15k per-fight deal.  He got destroyed in the title fight, spent the $500k, then was stuck with a mutli-fight deal for $15k.  Which left him and many fans very salty.

"A few years ago, I was sitting at the kitchen table at noon having lunch, thinking about going out and shooting some images.  A thought crossed my mind about the Grand Canyon, and I just said - yes.  Asked my wife if she wanted to go - no, are you crazy?  Loaded up the truck with absolutely everything I had, 16MP body along with my old 6MP (CCD) sensor body, all the glass I had, then took off for a 5 hour drive up to the canyon.

Yes, I made it for sunset, and shot with everything I brought.  To cut to the chase - the take (the images) that I captured were pretty good (my opinion).  The amazing surprise to me was, the 6MP CCD by its nature is wonderful, warm, colorful - saturated in its own natural right.  The 16MP body had the excellent more detailed resolution, that I wanted, but the colors were just ever so slightly muted - right out of the camera - when compared to the CCD.  Gear (well as long as you have some) does not matter that much.  It will provide images- the images the photographer shoots.

Everything makes a difference, sensor, glass (lens manufacturer - I shot with some Zeiss along with Pentax, both new (Zeiss ZK) and old (Takumar and Contax), it's all great - but there are slight differences), weather, sun angle, time of day, cloud cover, season, particulate matter in the air (fire somewhere?), location, shooting into the sun, away from the sun, everything, anything, whatever....

Then there is the post processing.  At that time my post processing skills were pretty non-existent, so the processing is pretty minimal.  So, here are a few - selected to show some differences across sensor type and size along with the ambient lighting.

Are these my best - no!, not by a long shot, but they tell a story (to me) - different sensors, different glass, and changing lighting.  Image number 3 and 4 (same camera same lens) - to me tells a story about the dramatic change in lighting.  Even 14 year old CCD technology is still very capable and useful, even with very little light - long exposure, low noise is your friend.  You can still do a lot with it.  Comparing #1 to #3, 16MP CMOS to 6MP CCD, also tells a story - about the sensor, its resolution and captured color.  Both capable, but different.

I posted them, and one of the comments I received was from someone in France.  That I had pushed the colors A LOT.  He had been to the Grand Canyon on a tour and it looked nothing like this.  Well, on the tours, it's a 4 hour drive from Las Vegas, arriving around 10am, then leaving around 2 pm to return.  This is the absolute worse time to see the canyon - no shadows, no low sun angle, no sun reflection, little color, bright sun directly overhead, none of the reds, oranges, purples, dark shadows, pinks, yellows, etc.  Pretty much everything is washed out.

The point is - that everything matters, especially what, when and how the photographer decides to shoot.  It's just not all the most current gear (older CCD technology is still excellent), and how the images are post processed, - the environmental factors going into the raw images, the basic information - also matters just as much.

3. SEC - Jeremy Pruitt has some serious work to do on the quality of the team at Tennessee.  Granted beat by a solid WVU squad but talent just wasn't there.
4. B12 - Tom Herman is in big, big (12 times) trouble at Texas.   Losing to Maryland twice (with a team that just lost a ton of key staff) is no bueno in the lone star state.

And for EW, while they are the main media for GOT, they have to interpret everything they see on set.

If you want to go that route just bear in mind that both the theory and the actual pragmatic applications are very important.  You want to be someone who can read a paper on the latest graphics techniques and understand what is being described AND then take that to a modern graphics API or game engine and apply that understanding.  Another great way to take that is if you find yourself really digging graphics you can jump into materials, shaders, programs like Substance and Houdini and consider the Tech Art route.

TBH I rarely look at actual coursework on a resume.  That said, going the route of ""big data"" can be useful if you want to be more on the platform side of game dev.  It's less sexy but there is definitely demand.  This is stuff like setting up back end services from databases to account services and even game servers and making sure that they don't keel over in the face of large numbers of players.

Stuff like physics and machine learning are less directly applicable but totally useful IMO just in the sense that anything like that is teaching you good problem solving skills.  I was an academic before I turned into a game dev and while 90% of what I studied/research has little direct value for game dev, it still went a long way towards giving me the raw problem-solving skills needed to make games.

Just make sure that whatever you're doing you're finding an outlet to write plenty of code.  A good CS program will help with that (and a bad one will force too much book learning on you) but try and do more.  Pick a game engine and start making games with it."

If you do this, Instagram it.  Because at the very least, she could have attended the ceremony but chose not to do that.  Rude and deserving of shame.

Second:

I married later as well - attended so many wedding showers, baby showers, first birthday parties, recitals, etc.  And from my side, despite sending out Save-the-Dates nearly a year in advance, I had a 60% refusal rate.  Some people claimed they couldn't find babysitters - we're talking people who lived 10 minutes from the venue and invites were sent out 8 weeks ahead of the wedding - some people said they had other plans (and were totally vague about it), and some people didn't even bother RSVPing at all.  I felt bad for my parents because some of these were their family friends, too, for whom they had made the effort to attend wedding for their children.  It felt like an insult.

Guess what?  When it's come to subsequent events in their lives, I've had no problem RSVPing ""No thank you.""  (And so did my parents where it applied to them.) I figure at least I'm giving them the courtesy of an RSVP.  I also knew which friends to value - the friends who would make an effort.

Like many others here, though, I am questioning your Mom's devotion to your sister.  Unless there's some travel involved, there is no reason I can think of that she can't leave her cell phone on vibrate in her purse and keep checking it.  Or even if there is travel, there's no saying she can't just fly in for her other daughter's wedding and then fly right back out.  I get your sister is probably scared and frustrated, and maybe your Mom is trying to make her feel better by not being the only one to miss your wedding...but your Mom is missing your wedding in preference to your sister.  I feel like you should be able to talk to your Mom about this before the day, especially since there's no saying your sister is even going to deliver a month ahead of time."	So...not the GOP then.

"Auston Matthews is the best even strength goal scorer in the league and also great defensively.  He was the best player on the Leafs by a country mile.

He said something he knew was inflammatory and liable to backfire, and it did.  Once he understood the error, he retracted the statement and (trigger warning) apologized.  

The only reasoning you're using is that for him to have this view he must be getting his information from Nazi's and their sympathizers.  

His entire persona is as a commentator on the absurdities in politics.  *Of course* he is reading Nazi output.  Anyone who wants to understand their perspective and how their brain works should.

3.  Stop trying to give Lara a mythology in the first place.  Make the game about a treasure hunter that raids tombs.  Nuts, I know.

4.  Understand that if something story wise does not manifest in gameplay...it actually doesnt exist.  One of the big problems in gaming is that no one notices this extremely crucial design truth.  Cutscenes, characters, monologues, action setpieces - all useless unless they matter in the game to the gamer.

5.  RAW FUCKING GAMEPLAY PEOPLE.  Video games are meant to be played, not watched.  For the (probably millions of) dollars spent on character design, voice acting, and cutscenes, they could have quadrupled the amount of puzzles in the game, added more gear/tools, and maybe even woven it all together to form a cohesive experience.

1.  Go check out the survival mode from Rise - its more of a tomb raider game than either tomb raiders despite being bare bones as fuck.  Shes dumped into treacherous environment, and she has to hunt food, gather tools, craft shit, and OMG raid tombs.

2.  Collectables are useless without tangible rewards that manifest in the game.  Both TR games can be completed without ever picking up a single thing.  The rewards are borderline meaningless, and this includes ability upgrades - they just make an easy game even easier.

3.  Check out the DLC portion of rise - its a giant puzzle with tons of little puzzles inside, and it has a boss battle.  Its more like Tomb Raider than the game its a part of.

4.  Make puzzles for people over the age of 7.  The first game had some good ones, whereas Rise had 15 ""use the rope arrow"" puzzles.  The game is about a psychopathic murderer who butchers and entire civilization, but its written and designed for people in grade school.

5.  If youre holding the analog in a direction while the entire universe collapses, youre not actually playing the game and everything happening on screen is meaningless.  This goes for long traversal sequences as well (where the only real punishment for failure is that you have to endure not playing for longer periods).  Uncharted has this exact problem.

6.  If every enemy is as stupid and weak as the first ones you encounter, the game is actually over when it starts.  Both TR games have almost no enemy types, and the few there are have identical behaviors and weaknesses.  

7.  None of these games are Tomb Raider.  They are Uncharted - an action and shooting game with ultra light puzzles and completely mindless platforming.  

If I made a Tomb Raider game, itd be about a girl named Lara Croft that goes into a massive and treacherous tomb, has to solve puzzles, and fight to survive against wild animals and evil competing treasure hunters.  Itd be puzzle heavy and survival heavy, where death actually matters.  Where puzzles require using tools to solve problems.  Id drastically reduce the amount of shooting sequences and the boring, predictable Uncharted sequences.  She would have no friends, no sidekicks, and no stupid usless plots about nothing.  Objectives would be based in gameplay with organic justifications like "" I need to go get this tool in order to proceed"" instead of "" the cutscene and objective markers told me to do this"".    Itd be me (the player) and Lara (the avatar) telling the story.  The mechanical makeup of the game wouldnt need to change at all, but what is prioritized in terms of design would be completely changed to favor a treacherous, difficult, and frightening journey.

Basically the law in that state was nothing that flew up in the air.  

That said he had a great yarn about one year wanting to treat the local kids, so put out the word to a few kids (this was back when kids were free to roam around town on their own) to gather at a park that had a hillside facing a flat field.  He'd ordered a cake.  He showed up at the park and the hillside was absolutely covered with tons of kids.  He walked out to the middle, lit the fuse on the cake, and walked away.

Later I learned a local auto parts store near our hometown sold fireworks out the back.  Fireworks of any type were illegal back then and they got busted at some point.  They've since legalized certain small fireworks supposedly, so it's become a free for all as realistically nothing's enforceable.

It's not really about the actual value of the company.  It's about *percieved* value.  I have bought and sold Tesla stocks 4 different times.  I don't own any Tesla currently because I believe it's on a slide.  But I'm not opposed to buying it again.


People are emotional creatures.  They *want* Tesla to succeed.  They like the *idea* of what Tesla is trying to do.   And because of that, they buy the stocks because ""it's the future"".

Realistically, they are losing money left and right.  But because of infrastructure investments people think it will eventually be enormous.  So they buy stocks and drive the share price up.


There are two big things that currently have me worried about Tesla and why I sold my shares.  Most importantly is production ramp up problems with the model 3.  If they would have met or exceeded their deadlines on that car, I would have rode it all the way to the bank.  But they have so much riding on that car, it could be a back breaker if they can't get them moving.

The other big thing is the threat from labor unions.  I worked for a company providing logistics to every major automotive manufacturer.  And unions are a cancer for that particular industry.  I realize they are good for the employees.  I'm not anti-union.  And in some other countries they work well for automotive.  But if you want to make money manufacturing cars in the US, the last thing you want is a union.

To mitigate thus, Tesla tries to use robotics as much as possible.  So it might not hurt them as much as it hurts other manufacturers.  The model 3 is the biggest problem. "	Even older.

The OED provides several examples of gender being used for:  
1. Humans since 1474.  
2. Social or cultural differences rather than biological ones, since 1945.

*In the 20th cent., as sex came increasingly to mean sexual intercourse, gender began to replace it (in early use euphemistically) as the usual word for the biological grouping of males and females.*  
  
*It is now often merged with or coloured by sense 3b:   
Psychology and Sociology (orig. U.S.). The state of being male or female as expressed by social or cultural distinctions and differences, rather than biological ones; the collective attributes or traits associated with a particular sex, or determined as a result of one's sex.*

That depends on the average relative humidity where you are located.  More environmental humidity, the more dehumidifiers you will need, and the more often you'll have to apply oil.

As a rule of thumb, I usually reapply an oil coat every 1-2 months if I haven't taken a given gun out to the range and cleaned it already.



"	"The functionality has been in Chrome for a few releases now, what's changing in Chrome 66 is that it's being enabled *by default*.

If you're using Chrome today and want to turn it on, you can go to `chrome://flags`, search for the flag titled ""Autoplay Policy"" and change its setting to ""Document user activation is required"".

Since mid-October, Chrome has been keeping track of which sites you regularly watch video on and if you both visit a site regularly *and* regularly allow videos with sound to play for more then 7 seconds, Chrome will allow that site to continue to autoplay video.  (This is to allow sites like YouTube and Netflix to continue to work like you want them to.)   You can view Chrome's statistics on how often you watch video on a site by going to `about://media-engagement`.  Any row with ""Is High"" that reads 'Yes' will be able to autoplay videos.

Also, this autoplay policy only applies to videos that aren't muted.  Muted videos, or videos without sound will continue to be able to autoplay.  This also applies to *any* sound by the webpage -- pages won't be able to make sound until you interact with them by clicking on them.

Also keep in mind some sites, like CNN, use some underhanded tricks to get around this autoplay restriction (by not actually navigating to a new page when you click a link; but instead just swapping out the *current* page's content) so they'll still be able to 'autoplay' on everything *except* the first page you visit until Chrome comes up with some plan to address that behavior.   For sites like that, you can permanently mute them by right-clicking on the tab and choosing ""Mute site"", which will persist between visits.  (You can undo ""Mute site"" by clicking on the icon at the left edge of the address bar and changing the permissions for Sound back to ""Use global default"".)   In those cases, video will still play, but it won't be allowed to make any sound."	That makes a lot of sense.  Thank you for explaining.

"&gt; There may be a dip depending on the tension applied to the chain and the weight of the chain, in which case there would be a higher load on the ends, which now have a vertical component to their force, similar to if the chain was dangling free. If the chain is pulled taut, however, the load would be the same everywhere.

This is wrong.  There will always be a dip in the chain, even if you can't see it.  As such,  there will always be a greater force at the ends of the chain than the middle, because (just as in the vertical case) extra tension has to be applied to the chain to support the weight of the links.  

If this seems wrong to you, imagine a perfectly horizontal chain.  All the tension in this case would be horizontal, and therefore the tension would have no vertical component.  The only force acting vertical would be gravity.  If gravity is acting on the link, and there is no counteracting force, what happens to the link?"

It is common practice in Chicago for even small single family home, two flats and 3 flats (2-3 unit condos) to be built by an LLC.  Once sold, the LLC dissolves.  When there are inevitable problems that one would sue a builder to fix, there is no longer a legal entity around to sue.  Buyers can also sue the previous owners if there were undisclosed problems due to work where the proper permits were not pulled and inspections performed.  The new owner has no recourse when buying from an LLC which will be disolved once the sale is complete.	I think the era of significant growth my be over, but I can't see Facebook going away.

Yes, a Magna Carta and movement towards democracy is, in my opinion also, the likely endgame, and a Targaryen restoration will *not* help that.  If anything, I suspect that all three dragons and all of House Targaryen will be killed before the end, and I suspect neither Daenerys nor Jon will live to see spring, and there will be no Iron Throne.

And you can separate the character from the cause.  Daenerys Targaryen is a fascinating character torn between warring identities, trying and failing to be a good queen when all she longs for is freedom and a home.  I like her as a character.  I happen to also like Arya as a character.  That doesn't mean I think Arya Stark should sit the Iron Throne (though that would be a *fun* story).

The Starks are *people*.  The Targaryens are *people*.  You can be a fan of *people* who are at odds with each other.  The conflict is more interesting and fun if I like both sides.

If you want to judge characters' or institutions' actions, then you have to examine every aspect, the good and the bad.  The Iron Throne is a flawed and horrible institution, but it lay the foundation for a united, diverse Westeros.  It will collapse (hopefully soon), and when it does, a better order will rise to take its place, but I will argue that Westeros is better for having had the Iron Throne than not.

"Yep, after I came off active duty and went into the reserves DFAS did not pay me for my first three drill weekends.  Then DFAS sent me a letter saying I'd been overpaid by, you guessed it, an amount equivalent to three drill weekends.  I appealed this and asked for an audit, they complied.  While the appeal was on-going they transferred the debt to another department and stopped the audit.  When the time was up for the audit I called, found out the audit had stopped, and once again requested an audit as part of my appeal.  While the second audit was on-going the ""debt"" was transferred to the Treasury Department's collection team who added a $200 fee for their services, so now my ""debt"" is well over $800 and is accruing interest.

"&gt; The exploit description makes it seem like the downloaded resources aren't code signed by Blizzard?

The exploit description doesn't mention anything about pushing downloaded resources to the client through the Blizzard app.  From what it says:

&gt; Exploitation would involve using network drives, or setting destination to ""Downloads"" and making the browser install dlls, datafiles, etc

Looks like the exploit here is to force the payload into the browser's download directory (or, probably, more easily into the browser's cache directory), then repointing the Blizzard app to think that's where a game is installed and asking the app to launch it.  Their 'fix' is to make it so the client doesn't believe any browser executable is a game, so the app can't be used to launch and send command-line arguments to a browser in order to further instrument an intrusion (e.g., having the browser download a payload that the app can then execute in a separate command).

Blizzard's app only downloads content via Blizzard's CDN (which is basically Bittorrent-based) and directed via catalog files served up from their own servers, so the attack here isn't forcing the app to download an arbitrary payload.  The attack here is tricking the app into *executing* an already-downloaded payload because the app doesn't verify that what it's asked to execute is genuine Blizzard code, it just trusts whatever's in the 'game directory'."

Yeah, the constantly increasing prices tend to push landlords to just hike rents constantly.

My city isn't like that.  I've definitely met slum lords that I despised.  But 

&gt; The city needs to step up for the interests of residents over those of wealthy investors.

You don't understand- they *are*.  They are just prioritizing *homeowner* residents over renters. :/

Anything that encourages more building devalues other houses.  At this point, they *need* to be devalued.  But homeowners fight that tooth and  nail.

&gt; (Note: ""affordable housing"" doesn't just mean ""places for homeless people"" as a comment above indicated. It literally means housing within a market-rate budget. There isn't enough for people working 40+ hrs making well above min wage, much less the homeless.)

I 100% agree with you.  The solution is more market-rate housing.  Absentee landlords get away with it because *they have no competition*.  There's a ton of reasons for this.  Rent control can create this scenario, but lack of development also causes this scenario.  If Zoning laws artificially prevent new competition from arising, and regulation makes it really expensive to develop new land, and local populations oppose changing zoning laws...this stuff spirals out of control.

&gt; In summary: Fuck private developers

Developers usually just go where the money is.  I don't know your city's specific situation, but I'd guess either (A) the city refuses to approve new developments or (B) the city has overregulated development so much that it's just too expensive, but the city is probably subsidizing the horse-racing track.


The problem IMHO comes down to city policies.  Landlords can be part of the problem but they are driven by market forces.  Developers are part of the problem but are driven by market forces.  The city can manipulate market forces. And generally *growing cities are too afraid to hurt the private homeowners*, so they try really hard to preserve the status quo, which inherently leads to these kinds of spirals.


The kinds of things I'm talking about would hurt me as a landlord, but I don't live in a city with a market like this and actively avoid buying in to them because I don't think it's sustainable.  What's really scary is *new* landlords.  Let's say someone just moved to San Francisco and bought a $1 million property that they are renting for $3.5k/mo, and then a bunch of new developments come in and drive down their rent to $2k/mo- suddenly, that guy can't pay his mortgage anymore and has to get foreclosed on.  And y'know what?  *That's probably necessary* to get rents down.  But if that happens *too* fast, you could see a massive upheaval in the market as people get foreclosed left and right.

I stay away from markets like that because (A) it just seems unsustainable and I don't want to be part of the problem or be at risk in a crash (my city stayed relatively stable through 2008), and (B) lol I can't afford a $1 million house.  I live in a city with a $200k median home price and $900 median rent."	Fuck ticket rip off.  If i can't buy a ticket without using them, i just don't go. 	"Also, per your ""repression"" argument there's actually a sense in which childhood memories are simply ""repressed"".  It's not really the case that babies ""don't have longterm memory"".  More specifically it is the case that memory is associative: you are able to recall things through associations in your brain that lead you to a specific memory.  When you have experiences that you cannot remember, e.g. you experience something while drunk/high/asleep, it's not that the memory doesn't exist.  Rather it's the case that your mental state when you created the memory is so vastly different from your current mental state that you are unable to create the associations that would lead you to that memory.  This is why it is common to remember a dream while waking up (you're in a mental state closer to sleep) but be unable to access those memories once fully awake.  Similarly a memory formed while drunk will be easier to recall if you get drunk again.

In other words, it's very likely that your brain does contain a memory of your circumcision.  It's simply the case that your adult brain is so far removed from your baby brain that there is no reasonable way to access it, much like a repressed memory."	"Sneak Arch.....

The American left had to get tough on corporate taxes, the same way some countries have to get tougher and tougher on drugs until the penalties are ridiculous (in Singapore drug possession can get you the death Penalty).  The American left gave us the highest corporate tax rate in the world 35%, whereas Ireland and the Netherlands had 8-12%, and much lower when they played the ""double-Irish with a Dutch sandwhich shell game"".  

Here's the deal let's say you are a global company like Apple and you just made 30 Billion in profit, if you kept it in America you would only keep 19.5B, but if you played the shell game with the Netherlands and Ireland you'd keep 27.6B, but you wouldn't be allowed to spend it in the U.S.  

How do they do this?  It involves shell companies, international patent royalty law, and foreign corporate tax rates.  Basically whatever profit they make, they setup shell corporations that charge them exactly that in patent licensing fees in low tax havens.  The US can not fix this with an act congress we'd need to fix it internationally and World isn't interested because frankly it was a wealth transfer from us to them.  Our 500 - 850 Billion per year trade deficits aren't because we buy more foreign stuff it was a side affect our antiquated tax laws.  Now we dropped our corporate tax rates from roughly 4.5x to only 2.5x of what European countries are charging in corporate tax rates.  

While we wont race to the bottom by having the lowest tax rates, competitive tax rates have given these companies incentives to keep the money in the U.S.  This is why the Nasdaq (Tech index) is up 30% in 1 year since Trump, a 100 year record.  We now longer have antiquated tax policy literally forcing our companies to spend their profits in foreign countries.  

Microsoft, Google, and Apple were literally sitting on 450 Billion dollars in cash they couldn't bring into the US or else they'd lose 35%, now they only lose 21% still more than some European Countries offering them 8-12%.  but still enough to start shifting a lot of these profits back home.

You may have noticed record market growth, and record unemployment, but the cable news will never tell you this.  Also with the new Tax plan 1/3 of Americans used to have to itemize to get the best returns, now only 1/6 for most of America the standard deduction has been raised so high, that they no longer have to spend countless hours tracking down receipts.  

This has been a huge win, and if the news were interested in informing you instead of playing propaganda warfare you'd be happy too*

They are typically older than the girl in the pic, and social norms seem to vary between generations.  I'll definitely agree, asking is the safest because it compels them to at least give some sort of consent.  In talking to girlfriends and just other women I have learned that there are many times that a woman might say something is ok when she really doesn't want to do it, for example to not make a situation awkward, to keep the person from disliking them, or if they are concerned about there being an outcome that could end badly for them by saying ""No"" (summoning ""because of the implication"" meme).  That's why I think it's so important to learn to read body language.  Someone can verbally say yes when their body is clearly saying no, and it's really vital in this day and age to discern the difference.  In some ways that's what led to Louis CK's problems when he got wrapped up in the #metoo problem.  He asked women if it was ok for him to do something sexual in front of them, and although a couple verbally said yes they were not wanting it.  But you're right, women aren't monolithic.  There are cultural, generational, and personal differences between all of them.  What I try to rely on is my own experiences, successes, and failures.  As with all things, YMMV."	That's so eerie.

In urban development, we have a concept of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places - these are the places that we spend our time. First places are our homes, second places are our places of work, and third places are the places that we gather as a community and spend our leisure time.  Starbucks drives it's business model on that.  It's *good business* being a 3rd place that is inviting and welcoming to the community, regardless of intention to actually patronize the business, because 1 having a packed house builds up the appeal of the space as a place to go, 2, engendering good will with the community creates a loyalty with the people there, and 3, those people will buy something eventually and more often than not.

* My father is a Vietnam era veteran.  All of the kids were taught gun safety and responsibility from a young age, and taken to firing ranges once we were of age.  It wasn't really a hobby for us, more just a life skill.
* A family friend has a large farmstead out in the country and pays us to come out and shoot vermin, namely ground squirrels, that destroy his crops.
* I spend a lot of time outdoors where large animals are a concern.  I've only been in one scenario where a firearm needed to be used, and that was when a grizzly charged us on a fishing trip in Alaska.  Bear mace did nothing.

I see a lot of people posting something along the lines of ""I live in a safe urban/suburban area etc etc"" and I'm genuinely happy that they feel safe in their living situations.  I too lived in a wealthy upscale safe suburban neighborhood.  That didn't stop a drunk guy driving his car through our garage and entering the house, pardon the term, loaded for bear.  We lived less than a mile from the police station.  They took 20 minutes to respond.  Very lucky for us he blacked out before any damage could be done on either side.  I was 7 when this happened.

I'd also like to mention that not everyone does well with deep breathing - I get anxious about not being able to do it and breathe weirdly.

"&gt;&gt; No. I, like most of the middle class (who used to make good money doing manufacturing jobs), have had our jobs shipped overseas so that corporations can pay workers less.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is a natural evolution of a capitalist economy. 

I don't understand why people like you think that shareholders - who provide virtually nothing to a company - deserve all the company profits, while workers struggle to make ends meet.  Or need a second job.  And are denied healthcare, and medical leave, and just a plain vacation.

If all the workers are ""used up"" (physically and emotionally), there will be no workers to make the product that the rentiers depend on  for their profit.

Also, when all the resources are used up, where are the 1% going get their higher ""returns""?

&gt;People running corporations have a fiduciary duty to do their best to maximize profit for their investors, not employ more expensive workers.

Shouldn't they also take care of their resources?  Workers are a resource.  Once the people in Asia are tired of being treated as slaves, they'll demand more rights and higher wages and be ""more expensive""...

&gt;&gt;I said ""the world"", not a terrorist sect in Nigeria.

&gt;You don't think the US Navy has ships patrolling the globe? Now, who's willfully ignorant?

I don't even know what you're trying to say.

&gt;What, you want to give our EPA dominion over the entire planet now?

Of course not.  I expect corporations to take better care of the planet's resources rather than rape the entire thing.  It's the only planet humans can live on, after all.

They could use products that are produced using sustainable practices.  (Which is what was promised, but there will be a slight delay since there's still some old growth forest out there.  You know, killing the dodo bird was an accident caused by ignorance.  You can't say that we're killing species out of ignorance now.)

&gt;&gt;As far as healthcare goes, we all pay for the uninsured.

&gt;...if we go to a single payer system, so it will be cheaper (according to collectivists everywhere), that's when you really see the costs spike, since it will drive demand through the roof.

According to whom?

&gt;And how many people file for bankruptcy due to medical costs? You think that's not paid for by the rest of us?

&gt;&gt;So, your solution is to subsidize those people that don't pay for their own care even more, driving up demand even more.

Wut?  No.   Universal healthcare would ensure that middle class people - who own their own homes - don't have to file for medical bankruptcy and become one of those homeless people who failed at capitalism that you so despise.

&gt;&gt;And ask any retiree if they want to get rid of their Medicare.

&gt;They only wouldn't want to get rid of it because they've paid into it their whole lives.

A good example of this (that is less valid as it is my understanding that this has been changed some now) is Ship Insurance.

It is my understanding that the original idea is that ships could be hijacked by players, but that if you have your ship insured, you get either a new ship or credit enough to purchase a new ship.  To the discerning eye, a lot of questions are raised here, primarily 'How do prevent massive amounts of wealth from being generated from thin air?'  What is stopping players from colluding and generating a massive number of ships as quickly as they can file a claim with an NPC?

This kind of design represents a massive misunderstanding on how players interact with game systems and leaves huge holes for exploitation.

Now, I think they've since walked back on that and said you get to keep a stolen ship for as long as you are logged in, but you can't trade it or otherwise generate wealth from it.  This *still* leaves open room for exploitation, but it's a lot more nuanced and difficult to abuse.

-----

This is but one example though.  Another favorite of mine is 'what is exactly does it mean to have a land claim?'  What can you do with that land?  Sell it?  Mine it?  Build on it? Rent it?  Do Resources regenerate? If so, at what cadence?  Does the claim ever expire?  If so, at what frequency and how is it the existing stuff on it get allocated?  If you can't steal or otherwise maliciously act on other people's land, then doesn't that put yet another bullet in the 'piracy' career?  If you can, then why buy and at all, since it's allegedly super common?

This is just scratching the surface on what a 'land claim' actually means, but very little has been answered specifically.  This can be repeated ad nauseum for almost every mechanic in the game - There is no design specific and so it's hard to derive actual value of these things.  Any discussion of this sort gets shot down because the reality is that a things like 'land claims' and 'ship insurance' have major problems when it comes to wrapping them into an actual game and it puts a dead stop to feature projection.

The national media and the entire country gives a damn about Kavanaugh becaide he will ultimately be deciding the issues that WILL impact a woman and her right to choose.  He is then denying those allegations and doesn't think an investigation is necessary.

Ellison is calling for an investigation into Monahan' s claims.  Furthermore, the son who says he has the video has either misplaced it or can't find it and has not provided any other corrobating evidence at this time.  She says she shared the texts of a convo with others, and those people haven't come forward.

So to reiterate,  in one instance, we have mutilple people, including Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge telling us all about his drunken escapades and harassment but he doesn't want an investigation while he prepares to potentially be placed on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment, vs. Someone saying they had a video but no longer and an accussed calling for an investigation of himself into those claims.  He is furthermore mirrored by polling in Minnesota where ~60% want an investigation to determine the facts.

Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation, Trump, McConnell, Grassley and others don't want an investigation.  Ellison does, Minnesotans do, and a vast majority of Americans want more info on Kavanaugh.

And guess what, if the allegations against Ellison are indeed true, he will probably be forced from office in a manner similar to what happened with Al Franken.

I picked ""I want to be the greatest mage that ever lived.""  So I went straight to the mage college from the start of the game, walking the whole way.  I immediately went to the college and started the quests there.  I only deviated when I was only level 11 and had to get the Staff of Magus.

I am sick to death of hearing how shameful it is to be white, and male.  It's not even acceptable, as evidenced by recent trolling to say ""it's ok to be white""...   I am also extremely sick of hearing that it's the evil guns, or the evil men that cause these atrocities such as the school shootings.  It simply isn't, it is people who are driven to the very edge of sanity, or were already on the fringe that commit these acts.  If you take a way the motive, a gun or a man becomes inert in respect to heinous acts.  Honestly, I rue the day that they actually win the gun debate.  Once that is not an efficient way to do damage, it will only be a matter of time before something even more lethal is used.

What do I mean by that?  To be clear, I do believe that there are such things as objective truths, and that we can determine what they are through observations, experiments, and logic.  (Or at least, we can form accurate subjective approximations to objective truths, which for most intents and purposes is good enough.  Did you know that 0.99999... is mathematically equal to 1.0?)  And when we observe human societies, we see that *it is an objective fact that humans disagree about moral issues*.  

You say this,

&gt;Once right is established, is it forever to be questioned?

but the problem is that right never has been established.  There has never been a point in history when a single moral code was established and accepted by all humans- and even if that did happen, it would not therefore follow that that code was the *right* one.  Surely you don't believe that morality is subject to a popular vote? 

There are real differences of opinion within human societies about weighty moral issues.  This thread in particular is about sexual assault.  Most of the commenters here would probably take the feminist position that it is immoral to have sex with someone who is highly intoxicated, especially if that person would not have wanted to have sex with you if they were sober.  A corollary of that view is that, if a man takes advantage of a woman who is in an intoxicated state, that the moral blame lies with the man.

However, that point of view is hardly the only human opinion on the topic.  Many other humans hold the opinion that, if a woman gets drunk and a man has sex with her without her consent, that it is in fact *her* fault for getting that drunk, or wearing something revealing, or going to a party, or whatever.  It is an *objective fact* that this victim-blaming view is widespread- in fact, it is probably much more widespread than the feminist view, even at the present day, and the feminist viewpoint becomes even more of a minority when you consider how cultural values have shifted over time.  The whole notion that sexuality is supposed to be about mutual pleasure, or that a woman's choices, preferences, and boundaries ought to matter during sex, is a profoundly *modern* idea.  

It is an *objective, historically observable fact* that moral values change over time and in response to shifting cultural patterns.  You can make the argument that moral values *should* be immutable, if you wish.  But that argument is merely a statement of your own subjective preference.  The objective fact of the matter is that societies do in fact change their moral values over time."	I haven't but I've been meaning to.

But the companies don't pay the sales tax.  Customers pay the sales tax."	"A few points: This globalist believes that equities are overvalued, and also that the tax cuts will drive up interest rates.  Keeping in mind that, at least in the article, there was absolutely no evidence put forth to support either that equities are overvalued, or that interest rates are going to go up significantly in the near term, the economics doesn't make sense on its face: If equities are overvalued, then it's because interest rates have been kept unnaturally low for a decade, forcing investor's out of bonds and into equities (or worse, Bitcoin, Gold, and other alternatives) in search of some reasonable return to support wealth accumulation and income generation.  If equities are over valued, then driving up interest rates is what we should want the most, as that will send hundreds of billions out of the equity market and in to fixed incomes.  

The IMF is talking out of both sides of its mouth.  Either equities are overvalued and so rising interest rates are good, or they are wrong about the overvalued equity market...and what?  If they are wrong about the overvalued equity market, then that minimizes the implicit risk of increased rates.  Higher risk free returns will be reflected in stock valuations and will slow the market down some, increasing the bond allocation overall from around 35% closer to a more historically normal 40%, and will push the dividend yield on the market to more normal levels from where they currently are (the cellar).  Increasing competition for capital and the need to provide higher dividend yield is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.

As others have pointed out, also, deficits aren't driven by tax receipts, alone.  I'm in no way convinced that the 10 year tax revenue impact to the government will not be higher from 2018-2028 than from the ten years prior, as the CBO and IMF have claimed.  If historic tax cuts are an indicator, then we should see around 1.2* return on the tax cuts, which would also and obviously detract from the globalist's concerns.  Alternatively, of course, we could cut spending to match inflows, if necessary.

All of that said: The IMF would never say anything that belied a sentiment other than being against tax cuts, spending cuts, or for anything in support of classical liberal economics, because that isn't what the IMF is about.  They were no more likely to speak in support of these tax cuts than Nancy Polosi was to vote for them, for reasons that have nothing to do with economics (as demonstrated by the fact that the economics if her argument are contradictory drivel).

I'm a trans woman.  Post transition, I finally, truly feel like a woman.  But I'm still not feminine.  I mean, I can present feminine, and I mostly do, because it helps me be accepted by society at large, but I'm not drawn to it.

The internal pressure you're feeling to take part in it is actually internalised pressure that originally came from society and its enforced gender roles.  And gender roles are fine in their own way if you get something out of them (for example, many trans women) but those same roles are problematical when they trap people, when we can't ""opt out"".

I always assumed that the war in heaven and man's fall from the garden of eden conincided with each other. Satan rebelled by refusing to bow down to God's creation, appeared as a dragon in the war in heaven. The snake's punishment in the garden for tricking eve was to crawl on his belly, implying that the dragon became the snake. When God struck Satan down from heaven he passed through the earth and into hell, so it makes sense that when he passed through the earth he did so in the form of what would later become the snake (a punishment for serving God's fallen angel).

Also it wouldn't make sense for Satan to pass through the earth in the form of man, given that Satan rejected man who was made in the image of God. It makes sense for the Dragon to pass through the earth in the form of the snake.

Yeah we do. The rates they charge are incredibly high and only because they have little competition.

In the town where Im gonna be articling old lawyers are literally dying without retiring because they can't find young lawyers to take over their clients.


&gt;The amount of legal work has remained the same — or even diminished — and there are more people willing to do it. 

It has most definitely NOT diminished, there are more laws, they are more complicated and there are more people.

Furthermore, it doesn't really matter that there are more lawyers when they still aren't meeting the demand at reasonable prices.

&gt;But what that really means is, “Hey, a few of you will have a stable job with a high income . . . good luck to the rest.”

This is simply not true. There are lots of jobs, the problem is people are unwilling to search outside the prestigious firms.

They are also unwilling to start their own practices and find their own clients, which there are lots of out there.

&gt;We have too many people who want to be lawyers and not enough jobs. 

That is absolutely untrue. There are more than enough legal problems to go around, people just can't afford the rates charged and many young lawyers are unwilling to move to small towns, they all wanna work downtown toronto, vancouver, etc.


&gt;So if lawyers charge too much and you think there is a good argument as to why pricing should be regulated to be lower (like how pricing for doctors and dentists is regulated) then make that case.

No that is bad option because there isn't enough supply. Simply regulating a certain price wouldn't increase supply.

Increasing the number of lawyers would both increase the supply and decrease the price.

Also, these things aren't mutually exclusive you can do a bit of both.

But from what I've seen in the video, and correct me if I'm wrong, they don't test the quality of the single parts like the display or the camera, the problem with OnePlus phones has never been with the build, it's been with the malfunction or failure of the display or the camera.

There's also the problem with software, every OnePlus phone since the first has had some kind of problem that was promised a software fix but most of the times they didn't deliver. 

Of course not everyone is affected by those problems, in fact my mother is still going strong with my old OPO, the only issues she has are with the sub par camera and slow charging (it probably doesn't help that she's lost the original charger).

All in all when I found out that they weren't an indipendent company I've always felt like I'd been tricked into buying a rebranded chinese phone marketed for a western audience (which is exactly what happened by the way, even though the OPO was an exceptionally good deal at the time), they've become shadier every year since then so they would need to prove me that they've changed before I consider buying another one of their phones."

Yet you're accusing me of omitting and skewing information - I'd like to know exactly what I've omitted or skewed in this discussion.  It's fine that they give that option to developers, but that really doesn't have anything to do with the point that I'm making. I said that steam is the biggest DRM system on the market, and it is. 

Systems like steam exist and have existed under different companies for many years. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, GOG, Ubisoft, EA, etc. You don't have to imagine what steam would have looked like under EA or Ubisoft, because they already exist and most other systems that I've used were just as good, if not better than steam, which takes up like 2 gigs of hard drive space and requires 50 mb updates seemingly every time i open it. 

Don't get me wrong, like I said I like steam and I use it. I just get annoyed that people bend over backwards to ward off any negative thoughts about it or valve, but then will at the same time froth at the mouth over another company. People personify these businesses like they're professional wrestlers and it's just really obnoxious how people have these unfounded biases and think one company is god's gift to gaming, while another, that could be doing something better (like GoG) is either ignored or bashed because it's against their naive hive minded train of thinking. This discussion literally proves my point on that. I'm being downvoted for calling a DRM system a DRM system, and you're being upvoted for suggesting that a DRM system is not a DRM system, I mean how obnoxious is that?

It's like that. Say an object/particle crosses the event horizon at a perpendicular angle, it's going to make a straight line to the singularity.

Say that same object crosses at a large fraction of c on a tangent. It may very well make it around a few times. It still gets to the center eventually, but even a photon at c if it's on a path that crossed the event horizon that path gets to the center. That path just might be 'orbiting' the core 100,000,000 times.

All mount speeds would be normalised, say to the slowest mount. The skimmer could retain its water traverse ability (so long as that didn't allow you to bypass barriers such as allowing you to enter green EBG keep without knocking down a wall first) but all other mount special attributes/abilities would be disabled, except PERHAPS in territory you own. Mount engage skills would not CC, except perhaps when fighting in owned territory.

I'd foresee mounts remaining usable in enemy territory, but perhaps losing max speed. Perhaps a world ability could allow you to move at full speed in enemy territory

It could be done, and could be done to the benefit of the game mode as a whole, imo. obviously i could be wrong, but especially now that we have mounts in pve, having to run on foot over the entirety of a map feels even slower and more frustrating than ever before, and i imagine that this has become a barrier to new people getting involved in &amp; enjoying WvW to the extent they might have before the introduction of mounts.

Of course, the addition of mounts would require numerous rebalances. Since increased movement speed means reduced reinforcement time when an objective falls under attack, it would be necessary to allow objectives to be captured faster, whether that means reducing NPC/wall/gate health or even just simply increasing the rate of capture when you control the circle. Some terrain alterations might need to be made, or invisible walls placed, so that people can't exploit the increased movement speed to enter objectives without first breaking a wall or the gate."

obviously more studies could be done etc. but the gist:


""""Alcohol was the most widely used substance among respondents, initiated earliest, and also the first substance most commonly used in the progression of substance use,"" the researchers concluded.

It's not clear to what degree, if any, this reflects greater availability of alcohol. Researchers typically see marijuana as in the same general universe of availability as alcohol and tobacco, simply because use of those three are so widespread compared to other substances. In fact 12th graders now are more likely to use marijuana than tobacco, despite one being legal and the other not. Jonathan Caulkins of Carnegie Mellon University told me last month that perceived availability of marijuana, as measured in the Monitoring the Future studies, has been at a high level for 20 years.

But we're still playing a game of ""which drug came first"" here. The researchers go on to argue that the question of which drugs kids start with is a lot less important than the question of how early they start using. ""Overall, early onset substance initiation, whether that is alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, exerts a powerful influence over future health risk behaviors,"" they write."""

"Yes I know, I was just trying to be polite to the NL nuthuggers who liked to believe that the AL teams had better records because they also had the 2 worst teams in baseball and that the NL teams were just as good because they had more competition.

But muh NL teams r gud too"	all facts. 	"You will need to learn about the uncertainty principle, it is difficult, but  not impossible. There are probably good youtube videos about it.

I can try to explain it quickly. Imagine that two persons can communicate only with waves. And they need to communicate the position and speed of a thing in one wave.

Short wave means fast. Long wave means slow. And the object is within the position of the whole wave. 

Now they can give a short wave which means the object is very fast, and because it is short the location is precise.

But the slower objects they try to explain, the longer and longer waves they must use. But those waves do not give the position. And  a thing that is still would be infinitely long wave, so it could be anywhere.

Reality is a bit like that. Things cannot be still and have a precise position.

"""Doom Side Of The Moon"" is a project by some members of The Sword and some other metal musicians to cover all of Dark Side Of The Moon in a more doom metal way.

We keep our surnames when marrying and the habit of changing one's surname is considered a socially obsolete thing.

Also, Italy has possibly the worst bureaucracy so changing one's name is a trip in hell. That also factors in the decision to NEVER FU***NG CHANGE YOUR NAME

Now Trump says that was a miscommunication. So will Hannity now say the miscommunication was great, or the retracting of the miscommunication is great?

Trump did a 180 and so both things can't be great."	It's interesting that the median wealth in Canada is quite a bit higher than the use, it's no small margin of difference. Also, there's less wealth owned by the top 10&amp;#37; in comparison to the US. We have a less wealthy society, but its certain a more equal and equitable society. 	"Lol just like in the show, the one classic face (Sting) is calm but assertive with his arguments whereas fuckin Roddy Piper is being his classic bad self. Love it!

""hurr durr  Russian shill"" is *not* a good argument, particularly when the person you're accusing of being a shill is active on reddit and is genuinely trying to discuss things in a civil manner.  Shit, it wouldn't even be a good argument against a shill because we already know they've driven up antagonism both on the left and right. They're trying to play people against eachother, not just support the right wing.

Meanwhile, you have not offered a single salient point in this entire thread and have only insulted people and dismissed their arguments as lunacy and shilling.

Didnt hear a difference."	"M0s give epic azerite gear, so yes from what we know these pieces will give some of the currency when scrapped.

And 2 weeks for who ? someone who only does M+ and only gets the currency from their weekly cache ? Sounds pretty fair to me. Someone who does every M0 + LFR + NM + HC Uldir + PVP conquest cap + warfronts + every emissary and scrap every piece they get ? I think it's pretty safe to assume it will take them less than 2 weeks, but how few people are actually willing to do that ?

You're complaining as if back in BC or WotLK most currencies were not capped at all, well guess what they were timegated too and it was fine.

I'm sorry but to me it sounds like you want azerite gear to be handed to you because you do one or two M+10 a week.

And again, just like all of us you have no idea how much of that currency will come from the weekly cache and how much will come from scrapped azerite pieces, so you shouldn't present your assumptions as something that everyone should know will inevitably happen.

You are being pessimistic and I can understand why, but when you're telling people that they are wrong for thinking what they think based only on your own assumptions, you are actually being dishonest."	Thank you..we were a pretty good team. but we kept running into Jordan. 	"Used to work in a vzw call center. I top wished the building was on fire.

You'd be surprised how often firefighters were called to the building. Whether it be someone put popcorn in the oven and forgot about it or someone had a seizure (or some medical emergency) and they came with the paramedics.

It was really upsetting to pull up, see a firetruck there and hope you wouldn't have to go in, then they just rolled off.
